DOMIN. {ENTER} [1]
SULLA. {ENTER} [2]
DOMIN. (_Dictating_) Ready? [4]
SULLA. Yes. [5]
DOMIN. To E. M. McVicker & Co., Southampton, England. “We undertake [6]
DOMIN. no guarantee for goods damaged in transit. As soon as the consignment [7]
DOMIN. was taken on board we drew your captain’s attention to the fact that [8]
DOMIN. the vessel was unsuitable for the transportation of Robots; and we are [9]
DOMIN. therefore not responsible for spoiled freight. We beg to remain, for [10]
DOMIN. Rossum’s Universal Robots, yours truly.” (_SULLA types the lines._) [11]
DOMIN. Ready? [12]
SULLA. Yes. [13]
DOMIN. Another letter. To the E. B. Huysen Agency, New York, U.S.A. “We [14]
DOMIN. beg to acknowledge receipt of order for five thousand Robots. As you [15]
DOMIN. are sending your own vessel, please dispatch as cargo equal quantities [16]
DOMIN. of soft and hard coal for R.U.R., the same to be credited as part [17]
DOMIN. payment (_BUZZER_) of the amount due us.” (_Answering phone_) Hello! [18]
DOMIN. This is the central office. Yes, certainly. Well, send them a wire. [19]
DOMIN. Good. (_Rises_) “We beg to remain, for Rossum’s Universal Robots, yours [20]
DOMIN. very truly.” Ready? [21]
SULLA. Yes. [22]
DOMIN. (_Answering small portable phone_) Hello! Yes. No. All right. [23]
DOMIN. (_Standing back of desk, punching plug machine and buttons_) Another [24]
DOMIN. letter. Freidrichswerks, Hamburg, Germany. “We beg to acknowledge [25]
DOMIN. receipt of order for fifteen thousand Robots.” [26]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [27]
DOMIN. Well, what is it? [29]
MARIUS. There’s a lady, sir, asking to see you. [30]
DOMIN. A lady? Who is she? [31]
MARIUS. I don’t know, sir. She brings this card of introduction. [32]
DOMIN. (_Reading card_) Ah, from President Glory. Ask her to come in-- [33]
DOMIN. (_To SULLA. Crossing up to her desk, then back to his own_) Where did I [34]
DOMIN. leave off? [35]
SULLA. “We beg to acknowledge receipt of order for fifteen thousand [36]
SULLA. Robots.” [37]
DOMIN. Fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand. [38]
MARIUS. (_At door R._) Please step this way. [39]
HELENA. {ENTER} [40]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [41]
HELENA. (_Crossing to desk_) How do you do? [43]
DOMIN. How do you do? What can I do for you? [44]
HELENA. You are Mr. Domin, the General Manager? [45]
DOMIN. I am. [46]
HELENA. I have come-- [47]
DOMIN. With President Glory’s card. That is quite sufficient. [48]
HELENA. President Glory is my father. I am Helena Glory. [49]
DOMIN. Please sit down. Sulla, you may go. [50]
SULLA. {EXIT} [51]
DOMIN. How can I be of service to you, Miss Glory? [53]
HELENA. I have come-- (_Sits R. of desk._) [54]
DOMIN. To have a look at our famous works where people are [55]
DOMIN. manufactured. Like all visitors. Well, there is no objection. [56]
HELENA. I thought it was forbidden to-- [57]
DOMIN. To enter the factory? Yes, of course. Everybody comes here with [58]
DOMIN. someone’s visiting card, Miss Glory. [59]
HELENA. And you show them-- [60]
DOMIN. Only certain things. The manufacture of artificial people is a [61]
DOMIN. secret process. [62]
HELENA. If you only knew how enormously that-- [63]
DOMIN. Interests you. Europe’s talking about nothing else. [64]
HELENA. (_Indignantly turning front_) Why don’t you let me finish [65]
HELENA. speaking? [66]
DOMIN. (_Drier_) I beg your pardon. Did you want to say something [67]
DOMIN. different? [68]
HELENA. I only wanted to ask-- [69]
DOMIN. Whether I could make a special exception in your case and show [70]
DOMIN. you our factory. Why, certainly, Miss Glory. [71]
HELENA. How do you know I wanted to say that? [72]
DOMIN. They all do. But we shall consider it a special honor to show [73]
DOMIN. you more than we do the rest. [74]
HELENA. Thank you. [75]
DOMIN. (_Standing_) But you must agree not to divulge the least-- [76]
HELENA. (_Standing and giving him her hand_) My word of honor. [77]
DOMIN. Thank you. (_Looking at her hand_) Won’t you raise your veil? [78]
HELENA. Of course. You want to see whether I’m a spy or not--I beg your [79]
HELENA. pardon. [80]
DOMIN. (_Leaning forward_) What is it? [81]
HELENA. Would you mind releasing my hand? [82]
DOMIN. (_Releasing it_) Oh, I beg _your_ pardon. [83]
HELENA. (_Raising veil_) How cautious you have to be here, don’t you? [84]
DOMIN. (_Observing her with deep interest_) Why, yes. Hm--of [85]
DOMIN. course--We--that is-- [86]
HELENA. But what is it? What’s the matter? [87]
DOMIN. I’m remarkably pleased. Did you have a pleasant crossing? [88]
HELENA. Yes. [89]
DOMIN. No difficulty? [90]
HELENA. Why? [91]
DOMIN. What I mean to say is--you’re so _young_. [92]
HELENA. May we go straight into the factory? [93]
DOMIN. Yes. Twenty-two, I think. [94]
HELENA. Twenty-two what? [95]
DOMIN. Years. [96]
HELENA. Twenty-one. Why do you want to know? [97]
DOMIN. Well, because--as-- (_Sits on desk nearer her_) You will make a [98]
DOMIN. long stay, won’t you? [99]
HELENA. (_Backing away R._) That depends on how much of the factory you [100]
HELENA. show me. [101]
DOMIN. (_Rises; crosses to her_) Oh, hang the factory. Oh, no, no, you [102]
DOMIN. shall see everything, Miss Glory. Indeed you shall. Won’t you sit down? [103]
DOMIN. (_Takes her to couch R.C. She sits. Offers her cigarette from case at_) [104]
DOMIN. (_end of sofa. She refuses._) [105]
HELENA. Thank you. [106]
DOMIN. But first would you like to hear the story of the invention? [107]
HELENA. Yes, indeed. [108]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to L.C. near desk_) It was in the year 1920 that old [109]
DOMIN. Rossum, the great physiologist, who was then quite a young scientist, [110]
DOMIN. took himself to the distant island for the purpose of studying the [111]
DOMIN. ocean fauna. (_She is amused._) On this occasion he attempted by [112]
DOMIN. chemical synthesis to imitate the living matter known as protoplasm [113]
DOMIN. until he suddenly discovered a substance which behaved exactly like [114]
DOMIN. living matter although its chemical composition was different. That [115]
DOMIN. was in the year 1932, exactly four hundred and forty years after the [116]
DOMIN. discovery of America. Whew-- [117]
HELENA. Do you know that by heart? [118]
DOMIN. (_Takes flowers from desk to her_) Yes. You see, physiology is [119]
DOMIN. not in my line. Shall I go on? [120]
HELENA. (_Smelling flowers_) Yes, please. [121]
DOMIN. (_Center_) And then, Miss Glory, Old Rossum wrote the following [122]
DOMIN. among his chemical experiments: “Nature has found only one method [123]
DOMIN. of organizing living matter. There is, however, another method, more [124]
DOMIN. simple, flexible and rapid which has not yet occurred to Nature at all. [125]
DOMIN. This second process by which life can be developed was discovered by me [126]
DOMIN. today.” Now imagine him, Miss Glory, writing those wonderful words over [127]
DOMIN. some colloidal mess that a dog wouldn’t look at. Imagine him sitting [128]
DOMIN. over a test tube and thinking how the whole tree of life would grow [129]
DOMIN. from him, how all animals would proceed from it, beginning with some [130]
DOMIN. sort of a beetle and ending with a _man_. A man of different substance [131]
DOMIN. from us. Miss Glory, that was a tremendous moment. (_Gets box of candy_) [132]
DOMIN. (_from desk and passes it to her._) [133]
HELENA. Well-- [134]
DOMIN. (_As she speaks his portable PHONE lights up and he answers_) [135]
DOMIN. Well--Hello!--Yes--no, I’m in conference. Don’t disturb me. [136]
HELENA. Well? [137]
DOMIN. (_Smile_) Now, the thing was how to get the life _out_ of the [138]
DOMIN. test tubes, and hasten development and form organs, bones and nerves, [139]
DOMIN. and so on, and find such substances as catalytics, enzymes, hormones in [140]
DOMIN. short--you understand? [141]
HELENA. Not much, I’m afraid. [142]
DOMIN. Never mind. (_Leans over couch and fixes cushion for her back_) [143]
DOMIN. There! You see with the help of his tinctures he could make whatever [144]
DOMIN. he wanted. He could have produced a Medusa with the brain of Socrates [145]
DOMIN. or a worm fifty yards long-- (_She laughs. He does also; leans closer_) [146]
DOMIN. (_on couch, then straightens up again_) --but being without a grain of [147]
DOMIN. humor, he took into his head to make a vertebrate or perhaps a man. [148]
DOMIN. This artificial living _matter_ of his had a raging thirst for life. It [149]
DOMIN. didn’t mind being sown or mixed together. That couldn’t be done with [150]
DOMIN. natural albumen. And that’s how he set about it. [151]
HELENA. About what? [152]
DOMIN. About imitating Nature. First of all he tried making an [153]
DOMIN. artificial dog. That took him several years and resulted in a sort of [154]
DOMIN. stunted calf which _died_ in a few days. I’ll show it to you in the [155]
DOMIN. museum. And _then_ old Rossum started on the manufacture of _man_. [156]
HELENA. And I’m to divulge this to nobody? [157]
DOMIN. To nobody in the world. [158]
HELENA. What a pity that it’s to be discovered in _all_ the school [159]
HELENA. books of both Europe and America. (_BOTH laugh._) [160]
DOMIN. Yes. But do you know what _isn’t_ in the school books? That old [161]
DOMIN. Rossum was mad. Seriously, Miss Glory, you must keep this to yourself. [162]
DOMIN. The old crank wanted to actually make _people_. [163]
HELENA. But you do make people. [164]
DOMIN. _Approximately_--Miss Glory. But old Rossum meant it literally. [165]
DOMIN. He wanted to become a sort of scientific substitute for _God_. He was a [166]
DOMIN. fearful materialist, and that’s why he did it all. His sole purpose was [167]
DOMIN. nothing more or less than to prove that God was no longer necessary. [168]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to end of couch_) Do you know anything about anatomy? [169]
HELENA. Very little. [170]
DOMIN. Neither do I. Well-- (_He laughs_) --he then decided to [171]
DOMIN. manufacture everything as in the human body. I’ll show you in the [172]
DOMIN. museum the bungling attempt it took him ten years to produce. It was [173]
DOMIN. to have been a _man_, but it lived for three days only. Then up came [174]
DOMIN. _young_ Rossum, an engineer. He was a wonderful fellow, Miss Glory. [175]
DOMIN. When he saw what a mess of it the old man was making he said: “It’s [176]
DOMIN. absurd to spend ten years making a man. If you can’t make him quicker [177]
DOMIN. than Nature, you might as well shut up shop.” Then he set about [178]
DOMIN. learning anatomy himself. [179]
HELENA. There’s nothing about _that_ in the school books? [180]
DOMIN. No. The school books are full of paid advertisements, and [181]
DOMIN. rubbish at that. What the school books say about the _united efforts_ [182]
DOMIN. of the two great Rossums is all a fairy tale. They used to have [183]
DOMIN. dreadful rows. The old _atheist_ hadn’t the slightest conception of [184]
DOMIN. industrial _matters_, and the end of it was that Young Rossum shut him [185]
DOMIN. up in some laboratory or other and let him fritter the time away with [186]
DOMIN. his monstrosities while he himself started on the business from an [187]
DOMIN. _engineer’s_ point of view. Old Rossum _cursed_ him and before he died [188]
DOMIN. he managed to botch up two physiological horrors. Then one day they [189]
DOMIN. found him dead in the _laboratory_. And that’s his whole story. [190]
HELENA. And what about the young man? [191]
DOMIN. (_Sits beside her on couch_) Well, anyone who has looked into [192]
DOMIN. human anatomy will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and [193]
DOMIN. that a good engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began [194]
DOMIN. to _overhaul_ anatomy to see what could be left out or simplified. In [195]
DOMIN. short--But this isn’t boring you, Miss Glory? [196]
HELENA. No, indeed. You’re--It’s awfully interesting. [197]
DOMIN. (_Gets closer_) So young Rossum said to himself: “A man is [198]
DOMIN. something that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk, [199]
DOMIN. and, in fact, wants to do a whole lot of things that are really [200]
DOMIN. unnecessary.” [201]
HELENA. Oh. [202]
DOMIN. That are unnecessary when he wants-- (_Takes her hand_) --let us [203]
DOMIN. say, to weave or count. Do you play the piano? [204]
HELENA. Yes. [205]
DOMIN. That’s good. (_Kisses her hand. She lowers her head._) Oh, I [206]
DOMIN. beg your pardon! (_Rises_) But a working machine must _not_ play the [207]
DOMIN. piano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things. [208]
DOMIN. A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And [209]
DOMIN. to manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as the manufacture [210]
DOMIN. of a gasoline motor. (_She is not interested._) The process must be [211]
DOMIN. the simplest, and the product the best from a practical point of view. [212]
DOMIN. (_Sits beside her again_) What sort of worker do you think is the [213]
DOMIN. _best_ from a practical point of view? [214]
HELENA. (_Absently_) What? (_Looks at him._) [215]
DOMIN. What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical [216]
DOMIN. point of view? [217]
HELENA. (_Pulling herself together_) Oh! Perhaps the one who is most [218]
HELENA. honest and hard-working. [219]
DOMIN. No. The one that is the _cheapest_. The one whose requirements [220]
DOMIN. are the _smallest_. Young Rossum invented a worker with the minimum [221]
DOMIN. amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected everything [222]
DOMIN. that did not contribute directly to the progress of work. Everything [223]
DOMIN. that makes man more expensive. In fact he _rejected man_ and made the [224]
DOMIN. _Robot_. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically [225]
DOMIN. they are more _perfect_ than we are; they have an enormously developed [226]
DOMIN. intelligence, but they have no soul. (_Leans back._) [227]
HELENA. How do you know they have no soul? [228]
DOMIN. Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside? [229]
HELENA. No. [230]
DOMIN. Very neat, very simple. Really a beautiful piece of work. [231]
DOMIN. Not much _in_ it, but everything in flawless order. The product of [232]
DOMIN. an engineer _is_ technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a [233]
DOMIN. product of Nature. [234]
HELENA. But man is supposed to be the product of God. [235]
DOMIN. All the worse. God hasn’t the slightest notion of modern [236]
DOMIN. engineering. Would you believe that young Rossum then proceeded to play [237]
DOMIN. at being God? [238]
HELENA. (_Awed_) How do you mean? [239]
DOMIN. He began to manufacture Super-Robots. Regular giants they were. [240]
DOMIN. He tried to make them twelve feet tall. But you wouldn’t believe what [241]
DOMIN. a failure they were. [242]
HELENA. A failure? [243]
DOMIN. Yes. For no reason at all their limbs used to keep snapping off. [244]
DOMIN. “Evidently our planet is too small for giants.” Now we only make Robots [245]
DOMIN. of normal size and of very high-class human finish. [246]
HELENA. (_Hands him flower; he puts it in button-hole_) I saw the first [247]
HELENA. Robots at home. The Town Council bought them for--I mean engaged them [248]
HELENA. for work. [249]
DOMIN. No. _Bought_ them, Miss Glory. Robots are bought and sold. [250]
HELENA. These were employed as street-sweepers. I saw them sweeping. [251]
HELENA. They were so strange and quiet. [252]
DOMIN. (_Rises_) Rossum’s Universal Robot factory doesn’t produce [253]
DOMIN. a uniform brand of Robots. We have Robots of _finer_ and _coarser_ [254]
DOMIN. grades. The best will live about _twenty_ years. (_Crosses to desk._) [255]
DOMIN. (_HELENA looks in her pocket mirror. He pushes button on desk._) [256]
HELENA. Then they die? [257]
DOMIN. Yes, they get used up. [258]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [259]
DOMIN. Marius, bring in samples of the manual labor Robot. [261]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [262]
DOMIN. I’ll show you specimens of the two extremes. This first [264]
DOMIN. grade is comparatively inexpensive and is made in vast quantities. [265]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [266]
ROBOT1. {ENTER} [267]
DOMIN. There you are, as powerful as a small tractor. Guaranteed [269]
DOMIN. to have average intelligence. That will do, Marius. [270]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [271]
ROBOT1. {EXIT} [272]
HELENA. They make me feel so strange. [274]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to desk. Rings_) Did you see my new typist? [275]
HELENA. I didn’t notice her. [276]
SULLA. {ENTER} [277]
DOMIN. Sulla, let Miss Glory see you. [279]
HELENA. (_Looks at DOMIN. Rising, crosses a step to C._) So pleased to [280]
HELENA. meet you. (_Looks at DOMIN_) You must find it terribly dull in this out [281]
HELENA. of the way spot, don’t you? [282]
SULLA. I don’t know, Miss Glory. [283]
HELENA. Where do you come from? [284]
SULLA. From the factory. [285]
HELENA. Oh, were you born there? [286]
SULLA. I was _made_ there. [287]
HELENA. What? (_Looks first at SULLA, then at DOMIN._) [288]
DOMIN. (_To SULLA, laughing_) Sulla is a Robot, best grade. [289]
HELENA. Oh, I beg your pardon. [290]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to SULLA_) Sulla isn’t angry. See, Miss Glory, the [291]
DOMIN. kind of skin we make. Feel her face. (_Touches SULLA’S face._) [292]
HELENA. Oh, no, no. [293]
DOMIN. (_Examining SULLA’S hand_) You wouldn’t know that she’s made of [294]
DOMIN. different material from us, would you? Turn ’round, Sulla. (_SULLA does_) [295]
DOMIN. (_so. Circles twice._) [296]
HELENA. Oh, stop, stop. [297]
DOMIN. Talk to Miss Glory, Sulla. (_Examines hair of SULLA._) [298]
SULLA. Please sit down. (_HELENA sits on couch._) Did you have a [299]
SULLA. pleasant crossing? (_Fixes her hair._) [300]
HELENA. Oh, yes, certainly. [301]
SULLA. Don’t go back on the _Amelia_, Miss Glory, the barometer is [302]
SULLA. falling steadily. Wait for the _Pennsylvania_. That’s a good powerful [303]
SULLA. vessel. [304]
DOMIN. What’s its speed? [305]
SULLA. Forty knots an hour. Fifty thousand tons. One of the latest [306]
SULLA. vessels, Miss Glory. [307]
HELENA. Thank you. [308]
SULLA. A crew of fifteen hundred, Captain Harpy, eight boilers-- [309]
DOMIN. That’ll do, Sulla. Now show us your knowledge of French. [310]
HELENA. You know French? [311]
SULLA. Oui! Madame! I know four languages. I can write: “Dear Sir, [312]
SULLA. Monsieur, Geehrter Herr, Cteny pane.” [313]
HELENA. (_Jumping up, crosses to SULLA_) Oh, that’s absurd! Sulla isn’t [314]
HELENA. a Robot. Sulla is a girl like me. Sulla, this is outrageous--Why do you [315]
HELENA. take part in such a hoax? [316]
SULLA. I am a Robot. [317]
HELENA. No, no, you are not telling the truth. (_She catches the amused_) [318]
HELENA. (_expression on DOMIN’S face_) I know they have forced you to do it for [319]
HELENA. an advertisement. Sulla, you are a girl like me, aren’t you? (_Looks at_) [320]
HELENA. (_him._) [321]
DOMIN. I’m sorry, Miss Glory. _Sulla is a Robot._ [322]
HELENA. It’s a lie! [323]
DOMIN. What? (_Pushes button on desk_) Well, then I must _convince_ [324]
DOMIN. you. [325]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [326]
DOMIN. Marius, take Sulla into the dissecting room, and tell them to open her up at once. [328]
HELENA. Where? [329]
DOMIN. Into the dissecting room. When they’ve _cut her open_, you can [330]
DOMIN. go and have a look. (_MARIUS makes a start toward SULLA._) [331]
HELENA. (_Stopping MARIUS_) No! No! [332]
DOMIN. Excuse me, you spoke of lies. [333]
HELENA. You wouldn’t have her killed? [334]
DOMIN. You can’t kill machines. Sulla! (_MARIUS one step forward, one_) [335]
DOMIN. (_arm out. SULLA makes a move toward R. door._) [336]
HELENA. (_Moves a step R._) Don’t be afraid, Sulla. I won’t let you go. [337]
HELENA. Tell me, my dear-- (_Takes her hand_) --are they always so cruel to [338]
HELENA. you? You mustn’t put up with it, Sulla. You mustn’t. [339]
SULLA. I am a Robot. [340]
HELENA. That doesn’t matter. Robots are just as good as we are. Sulla, [341]
HELENA. you wouldn’t let yourself be cut to pieces? [342]
SULLA. Yes. (_Hand away._) [343]
HELENA. Oh, you’re not afraid of death, then? [344]
SULLA. I cannot tell, Miss Glory. [345]
HELENA. Do you know what would happen to you in there? [346]
SULLA. Yes, I should cease to move. [347]
HELENA. How dreadful! (_Looks at SULLA._) [348]
DOMIN. Marius, tell Miss Glory what you are? (_Turns to HELENA._) [349]
MARIUS. (_To HELENA_) Marius, the Robot. [350]
DOMIN. Would you take Sulla into the dissecting room? [351]
MARIUS. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Yes. [352]
DOMIN. Would you be sorry for her? [353]
MARIUS. (_Pause_) I cannot tell. [354]
DOMIN. What would happen to her? [355]
MARIUS. She would cease to move. They would put her into the stamping [356]
MARIUS. mill. [357]
DOMIN. That is death, Marius. Aren’t you afraid of death? [358]
MARIUS. No. [359]
DOMIN. You see, Miss Glory, the Robots have no interest in life. They [360]
DOMIN. have no enjoyments. They are _less_ than so much grass. [361]
HELENA. Oh, stop. Please send them away. [362]
DOMIN. (_Pushes button_) Marius, Sulla, you may go. [363]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [364]
SULLA. {EXIT} [365]
HELENA. How terrible! (_To C._) It’s outrageous what you are doing. [367]
HELENA. (_He takes her hand._) [368]
DOMIN. Why outrageous? (_His hand over hers. Laughing._) [369]
HELENA. I don’t know, but it is. Why do you call her “Sulla”? [370]
DOMIN. Isn’t it a nice name? (_Hand away._) [371]
HELENA. It’s a man’s name. Sulla was a Roman General. [372]
DOMIN. What! Oh! (_Laughs_) We thought that Marius and Sulla were [373]
DOMIN. lovers. [374]
HELENA. (_Indignantly_) Marius and Sulla were generals and fought [375]
HELENA. against each other in the year--I’ve forgotten now. [376]
DOMIN. (_Laughing_) Come here to the window. (_He goes to window C._) [377]
HELENA. What? [378]
DOMIN. Come here. (_She goes._) Do you see anything? (_Takes her arm._) [379]
DOMIN. (_She is on his R._) [380]
HELENA. Bricklayers. [381]
DOMIN. Robots. All our work people are Robots. And down there, can you [382]
DOMIN. see anything? [383]
HELENA. Some sort of office. [384]
DOMIN. A counting house. And in it-- [385]
HELENA. A lot of officials. [386]
DOMIN. Robots! All our officials are Robots. And when you see the [387]
DOMIN. factory-- (_Noon WHISTLE blows. She is scared; puts arm on DOMIN. He_) [388]
DOMIN. (_laughs_) If we don’t blow the whistle the Robots won’t stop working. In [389]
DOMIN. two hours I’ll show you the kneading trough. (_BOTH come down stage._) [390]
DOMIN. (_HELENA is L.C. and DOMIN is R.C., arm in arm._) [391]
HELENA. Kneading trough? [392]
DOMIN. The pestle for beating up the paste. In each one we mix the [393]
DOMIN. ingredients for a thousand Robots at one operation. Then there are the [394]
DOMIN. vats for the preparation of liver, brains, and so on. Then you will [395]
DOMIN. see the bone factory. After that I’ll show you the spinning mill. [396]
HELENA. Spinning mill? [397]
DOMIN. Yes. For weaving nerves and veins. Miles and miles of digestive [398]
DOMIN. tubes pass through it at a time. [399]
HELENA. (_Watching his gestures_) Mayn’t we talk about something else? [400]
DOMIN. Perhaps it would be better. There’s only a _handful_ of us among [401]
DOMIN. a hundred thousand Robots, and _not one woman_. We talk nothing but the [402]
DOMIN. factory _all_ day, and _every_ day. It’s just as if we were under a [403]
DOMIN. curse, Miss Glory. [404]
HELENA. I’m _sorry_ I said that you were lying. (_A KNOCK at door R._) [405]
DOMIN. Come in. (_He is C._) [406]
GALL. {ENTER} [407]
FABRY. {ENTER} [408]
ALQUIST. {ENTER} [409]
HALLEMEIER. {ENTER} [410]
GALL. (_Noisily_) I beg your pardon. I hope we don’t intrude. [412]
DOMIN. No, no. Come in. Miss Glory, here are Gall, Fabry, Alquist, [413]
DOMIN. Hallemeier. This is President Glory’s daughter. (_ALL move to her and_) [414]
DOMIN. (_shake her hand._) [415]
HELENA. How do you do? [416]
FABRY. We had no idea-- [417]
GALL. Highly honored, I’m sure-- [418]
ALQUIST. Welcome, Miss Glory. [419]
BUSMAN. {ENTER} [420]
BUSMAN. (_Rushes in from R._) Hello, what’s up? [422]
DOMIN. Come in, Busman. This is President Glory’s daughter. This is [423]
DOMIN. Busman, Miss Glory. [424]
BUSMAN. By Jove, that’s fine. (_ALL click heels. He crowds in and_) [425]
BUSMAN. (_shakes her hand_) Miss Glory, may we send a cablegram to the papers [426]
BUSMAN. about your arrival? [427]
HELENA. No, no, please don’t. [428]
DOMIN. Sit down, please, Miss Glory. [429]
DOMIN. (_On the line, “Sit down, please,” all SIX MEN try to find her a_) [430]
DOMIN. (_chair at once. HELENA goes for the chair at the extreme L. DOMIN_) [431]
DOMIN. (_takes the chair at front of desk, places it in the C. of stage._) [432]
DOMIN. (_HALLEMEIER gets chair at SULLA’S typewriter and places it to R. of_) [433]
DOMIN. (_chair at C. BUSMAN gets armchair from extreme R., but by now HELENA_) [434]
DOMIN. (_has sat in DOMIN’S preferred chair, at C. ALL sit except DOMIN._) [435]
DOMIN. (_BUSMAN at R. in armchair. HALLEMEIER R. of HELENA. FABRY in swivel_) [436]
DOMIN. (_chair back of desk._) [437]
BUSMAN. Allow me-- [438]
GALL. Please-- [439]
FABRY. Excuse me-- [440]
ALQUIST. What sort of a crossing did you have? [441]
GALL. Are you going to stay long? (_MEN conscious of their_) [442]
GALL. (_appearance. ALQUIST’S trousers turned up at bottom. He turns them down._) [443]
GALL. (_BUSMAN polishes shoes. OTHERS fix ties, collars, etc._) [444]
FABRY. What do you think of the factory, Miss Glory? [445]
HALLEMEIER. Did you come over on the _Amelia_? [446]
DOMIN. Be quiet and let _Miss Glory_ speak. (_MEN sit erect. DOMIN_) [447]
DOMIN. (_stands at HELENA’S L._) [448]
HELENA. (_To DOMIN_) What am I to speak to them about? (_MEN look at_) [449]
HELENA. (_one another._) [450]
DOMIN. Anything you like. [451]
HELENA. (_Looks at DOMIN_) May I speak quite frankly? [452]
DOMIN. Why, of course. [453]
HELENA. (_To OTHERS. Wavering, then in desperate resolution_) Tell me, [454]
HELENA. doesn’t it ever distress you the way you are treated? [455]
FABRY. By whom, may I ask? [456]
HELENA. Why, everybody. [457]
ALQUIST. Treated? [458]
GALL. What makes you think-- [459]
HELENA. Don’t you feel that you might be living a better life? (_Pause._) [460]
HELENA. (_ALL confused._) [461]
GALL. (_Smiling_) Well, that depends on what you mean, Miss Glory. [462]
HELENA. I mean that it’s perfectly outrageous. It’s terrible. [463]
HELENA. (_Standing up_) The whole of Europe is talking about the way you’re [464]
HELENA. being treated. That’s why I came here, to see for myself, and it’s a [465]
HELENA. thousand times worse than could have been imagined. How _can_ you put [466]
HELENA. _up_ with it? [467]
ALQUIST. Put up with what? [468]
HELENA. Good heavens, you are living creatures, just like us, like the [469]
HELENA. whole of Europe, like the whole world. It’s disgraceful that you must [470]
HELENA. live like this. [471]
BUSMAN. Good gracious, Miss Glory! [472]
FABRY. Well, she’s not far wrong. We live here just like red Indians. [473]
HELENA. Worse than red Indians. May I--oh, may I call you--_brothers_? [474]
HELENA. (_MEN look at each other._) [475]
BUSMAN. Why not? [476]
HELENA. (_Looking at DOMIN_) Brothers, I have not come here as the [477]
HELENA. President’s daughter. I have come on behalf of the Humanity League. [478]
HELENA. Brothers, the Humanity League now has over two hundred thousand [479]
HELENA. members. Two hundred thousand people are on your side, and offer you [480]
HELENA. their help. (_Tapping back of chair._) [481]
BUSMAN. Two hundred thousand people, Miss Glory; that’s a tidy lot. Not [482]
BUSMAN. bad. [483]
FABRY. I’m always telling you there’s nothing like good old Europe. You [484]
FABRY. see they’ve not forgotten us. They’re offering us help. [485]
GALL. What kind of help? A theatre, for instance? [486]
HALLEMEIER. An orchestra? [487]
HELENA. More than that. [488]
ALQUIST. Just you? [489]
HELENA. (_Glaring at DOMIN_) Oh, never mind about me. I’ll stay as long [490]
HELENA. as it is necessary. (_ALL express delight._) [491]
BUSMAN. By Jove, that’s good. [492]
ALQUIST. (_Rising L._) Domin, I’m going to get the best room ready for [493]
ALQUIST. Miss Glory. [494]
DOMIN. Just a minute. I’m afraid that Miss Glory is of the opinion she [495]
DOMIN. has been talking to Robots. [496]
HELENA. Of course. (_MEN laugh._) [497]
DOMIN. I’m sorry. These gentlemen are human beings just like us. [498]
HELENA. You’re not Robots? [499]
BUSMAN. Not Robots. [500]
HALLEMEIER. Robots indeed! [501]
GALL. No, thanks. [502]
FABRY. Upon my honor, Miss Glory, we aren’t Robots. [503]
HELENA. Then why did you tell me that all your officials are Robots? [504]
DOMIN. Yes, the officials, but not the _managers_. Allow me, Miss [505]
DOMIN. Glory--this is Consul Busman, General Business Manager; this is Doctor [506]
DOMIN. Fabry, General Technical Manager; Doctor Hallemeier, head of the [507]
DOMIN. Institute for the Psychological Training of Robots; Doctor Gall, head [508]
DOMIN. of the Psychological and Experimental Department; and Alquist, head [509]
DOMIN. of the Building Department, R. U. R. (_As they are introduced they_) [510]
DOMIN. (_rise and come C. to kiss her hand, except GALL and ALQUIST, whom DOMIN_) [511]
DOMIN. (_pushes away. General babble._) [512]
ALQUIST. Just a builder. Please sit down. [513]
HELENA. Excuse me, gentlemen. Have I done something dreadful? [514]
ALQUIST. Not at all, Miss Glory. [515]
BUSMAN. (_Handing flowers_) Allow me, Miss Glory. [516]
HELENA. Thank you. [517]
FABRY. (_Handing candy_) Please, Miss Glory. [518]
DOMIN. Will you have a cigarette, Miss Glory? [519]
HELENA. No, thank you. [520]
DOMIN. Do you mind if I do? [521]
HELENA. Certainly not. [522]
BUSMAN. Well, now, Miss Glory, it is certainly nice to have you with us. [523]
HELENA. (_Seriously_) But you know I’ve come to disturb your Robots for [524]
HELENA. you. (_BUSMAN pulls chair closer._) [525]
DOMIN. (_Mocking her serious tone_) My dear Miss Glory-- (_Chuckle_) [526]
DOMIN. --we’ve had close upon a hundred saviors and prophets here. Every ship [527]
DOMIN. brings us some. Missionaries, Anarchists, Salvation Army, all sorts! [528]
DOMIN. It’s astonishing what a number of churches and idiots there are in the [529]
DOMIN. world. [530]
HELENA. And yet you let them speak to the Robots. [531]
DOMIN. So far we’ve let them all. Why not? The Robot remembers [532]
DOMIN. everything but that’s all. They don’t even laugh at what the people [533]
DOMIN. say. Really it’s quite incredible. [534]
HELENA. I’m a stupid girl. Send me back by the first ship. [535]
GALL. Not for anything in the world, Miss Glory. Why should we send [536]
GALL. you back? [537]
DOMIN. If it would amuse you, Miss Glory, I’ll take you down to the [538]
DOMIN. Robot warehouse. It holds about three hundred thousand of them. [539]
BUSMAN. Three hundred and forty-seven thousand. [540]
DOMIN. Good, and you can say whatever you like to them. You can read [541]
DOMIN. the Bible, recite the multiplication table, whatever you please. You [542]
DOMIN. can even preach to them about human rights. [543]
HELENA. Oh, I think that if you were to show them a little love. [544]
FABRY. Impossible, Miss Glory! _Nothing is harder to like than a Robot._ [545]
HELENA. What do you make them for, then? [546]
BUSMAN. Ha, ha, ha! That’s good. What are Robots made for? [547]
FABRY. For _work_, Miss Glory. One Robot can replace two and a half [548]
FABRY. _workmen_. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly _imperfect_. It [549]
FABRY. had to be removed sooner or later. [550]
BUSMAN. It was too expensive. [551]
FABRY. It was not _effective_. It no longer answers the requirements of [552]
FABRY. _modern engineering_. Nature has no idea of keeping pace with _modern [553]
FABRY. labor_. For example, from a technical point of view, the whole of [554]
FABRY. _childhood_ is a sheer absurdity. So much time lost. And then again-- [555]
HELENA. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Oh, no, no! [556]
FABRY. Pardon me. What is the real _aim_ of your League--the--the [557]
FABRY. Humanity League? [558]
HELENA. Its real purpose is to--to protect the Robots--and--and to [559]
HELENA. insure good treatment for them. [560]
FABRY. Not a bad object, either. A machine has to be treated properly. [561]
FABRY. (_Leans back_) _I don’t like damaged articles._ Please, Miss Glory, [562]
FABRY. enroll us all _members_ of your league. (_“Yes, yes!” from all MEN._) [563]
HELENA. No, you don’t understand me. What we really want is [564]
HELENA. to--to--_liberate_ the Robots. (_Looks at all OTHERS._) [565]
HALLEMEIER. How do you propose to do that? [566]
HELENA. They are to be--to be dealt with like human beings. [567]
HALLEMEIER. Aha! I suppose they’re to vote. To drink beer. To order us [568]
HALLEMEIER. about? [569]
HELENA. Why shouldn’t they drink beer? [570]
HALLEMEIER. Perhaps they’re even to receive wages? (_Looking at other_) [571]
HALLEMEIER. (_MEN, amused._) [572]
HELENA. Of course they are. [573]
HALLEMEIER. Fancy that! Now! And what would they do with their wages, [574]
HALLEMEIER. pray? [575]
HELENA. They would buy--what they want--what pleases them. [576]
HALLEMEIER. That would be very nice, Miss Glory, only there’s nothing [577]
HALLEMEIER. that does please the Robots. Good heavens, what are they to buy? You [578]
HALLEMEIER. can feed them on pineapples, straw, whatever you like. It’s all the [579]
HALLEMEIER. _same_ to them. They’ve no appetite at all. They’ve no interest in [580]
HALLEMEIER. anything. Why, hang it all, nobody’s ever yet seen a Robot smile. [581]
HELENA. Why--why don’t you make them--happier? [582]
HALLEMEIER. That wouldn’t do, Miss Glory. They are only workmen. [583]
HELENA. Oh, but they’re so intelligent. [584]
HALLEMEIER. Confoundedly so, but they’re nothing else. They’ve no will [585]
HALLEMEIER. of their own. No soul. No passion. [586]
HELENA. No love? [587]
HALLEMEIER. Love? Huh! Rather not. Robots don’t love. Not even [588]
HALLEMEIER. themselves. [589]
HELENA. No defiance? [590]
HALLEMEIER. Defiance? I don’t know. Only _rarely_, from time to time. [591]
HELENA. What happens then? [592]
HALLEMEIER. Nothing particular. Occasionally they seem to go off their [593]
HALLEMEIER. _heads_. Something like epilepsy, you know. It’s called “Robot’s [594]
HALLEMEIER. Cramp.” They’ll suddenly sling down everything they’re holding, [595]
HALLEMEIER. stand still, gnash their teeth--and then they have to go into the [596]
HALLEMEIER. stamping-mill. It’s evidently some breakdown in the mechanism. [597]
DOMIN. (_Sitting on desk_) A flaw in the works that has to be removed. [598]
HELENA. No, no, that’s the soul. [599]
FABRY. (_Humorously_) Do you think that the soul first shows itself by [600]
FABRY. a gnashing of teeth? (_MEN chuckle._) [601]
HELENA. Perhaps it’s just a sign that there’s a struggle within. [602]
HELENA. Perhaps it’s a sort of revolt. Oh, if you could infuse them with it. [603]
DOMIN. That’ll be remedied, Miss Glory. Doctor Gall is just making some [604]
DOMIN. experiments. [605]
GALL. Not with regard to that, Domin. At present I am making _pain_ [606]
GALL. nerves. [607]
HELENA. Pain nerves? [608]
GALL. Yes, the Robots feel practically no bodily pain. You see, [609]
GALL. young Rossum provided them with too limited a _nervous_ system. We [610]
GALL. _must_ introduce _suffering_. [611]
HELENA. Why do you want to cause them pain? [612]
GALL. For industrial reasons, Miss Glory. Sometimes a Robot does [613]
GALL. damage to himself because it doesn’t hurt him. He puts his hand [614]
GALL. into the machine-- (_Describes with gesture_) --breaks his finger-- [615]
GALL. (_Describes with gesture_) --smashes his head. It’s all the same to [616]
GALL. him. We must provide them with _pain_. That’s an automatic _protection_ [617]
GALL. against damage. [618]
HELENA. Will they be happier when they feel pain? [619]
GALL. On the contrary; but they will be more perfect from a [620]
GALL. technical point of view. [621]
HELENA. Why don’t you create a soul for them? [622]
GALL. That’s not in our power. [623]
FABRY. That’s not in our interest. [624]
BUSMAN. That would increase the cost of production. Hang it all, my [625]
BUSMAN. dear young lady, we turn them out at such a cheap rate--a hundred and [626]
BUSMAN. fifty dollars each, fully dressed, and fifteen years ago they cost ten [627]
BUSMAN. thousand. Five years ago we used to buy the _clothes_ for them. Today [628]
BUSMAN. we have our own weaving mill, and now we even _export_ cloth five times [629]
BUSMAN. cheaper than other factories. What do you pay a yard for cloth, Miss [630]
BUSMAN. Glory? [631]
HELENA. (_Looking at DOMIN_) I don’t really know. I’ve forgotten. [632]
BUSMAN. Good gracious, and you want to found a Humanity League. (_MEN_) [633]
BUSMAN. (_chuckle._) It only costs a third now, Miss Glory. All prices are today [634]
BUSMAN. a third of what they were and they’ll fall still lower, lower, like [635]
BUSMAN. that. [636]
HELENA. I don’t understand. [637]
BUSMAN. Why, bless you, Miss Glory, it means that the cost of _labor_ [638]
BUSMAN. has fallen. A Robot, food and all, costs three-quarters of a cent [639]
BUSMAN. per hour. (_Leans forward_) That’s mighty important, you know. All [640]
BUSMAN. factories will go pop like chestnuts if they don’t at once buy Robots [641]
BUSMAN. to lower the cost of production. [642]
HELENA. And get rid of all their workmen? [643]
BUSMAN. Of course. But in the meantime we’ve dumped five hundred [644]
BUSMAN. thousand _tropical_ Robots down on the Argentine pampas to grow corn. [645]
BUSMAN. Would you mind telling me how much you pay a pound for bread? [646]
HELENA. I’ve no idea. (_ALL smile._) [647]
BUSMAN. Well, I’ll tell you. It now costs two cents in good old [648]
BUSMAN. Europe. A pound of bread for two cents, and the _Humanity League_-- [649]
BUSMAN. (_Designates HELENA_) --knows nothing about it. (_To MEN_) Miss [650]
BUSMAN. Glory, you don’t realize that even _that’s_ too expensive. (_All MEN_) [651]
BUSMAN. (_chuckle._) Why, in five years’ time I’ll wager-- [652]
HELENA. What? [653]
BUSMAN. That the cost of everything will be a tenth of what it [654]
BUSMAN. is today. Why, in five years we’ll be up to our ears in corn [655]
BUSMAN. and--everything else. [656]
ALQUIST. Yes, and all the workers throughout the world will be [657]
ALQUIST. unemployed. [658]
DOMIN. (_Seriously. Rises_) Yes, Alquist, they will. Yes, Miss Glory, [659]
DOMIN. they will. But in ten years Rossum’s Universal Robots will produce so [660]
DOMIN. much _corn_, so much _cloth_, so much everything that things will be [661]
DOMIN. practically without price. There will be no poverty. All work will [662]
DOMIN. be done by living machines. Everybody will be free from worry and [663]
DOMIN. liberated from the degradation of labor. Everybody will live only to [664]
DOMIN. _perfect_ himself. [665]
HELENA. Will he? [666]
DOMIN. Of course. It’s bound to happen. Then the servitude of man to [667]
DOMIN. man and the enslavement of man to matter will cease. Nobody will get [668]
DOMIN. bread at the cost of life and hatred. The Robots will wash the feet of [669]
DOMIN. the beggar and prepare a bed for him in his house. [670]
ALQUIST. Domin, Domin, what you say sounds too much like Paradise. [671]
ALQUIST. There was something _good_ in _service_ and something _great_ in [672]
ALQUIST. humility. There was some kind of virtue in _toil_ and _weariness_. [673]
DOMIN. Perhaps, but we cannot reckon with what is lost when we start [674]
DOMIN. out to transform the world. Man shall be _free_ and supreme; he shall [675]
DOMIN. have no other aim, no other labor, no other care than to perfect [676]
DOMIN. himself. He shall serve neither matter nor man. He will not be a [677]
DOMIN. machine and a device for production. He will be _Lord_ of creation. [678]
BUSMAN. Amen. [679]
FABRY. So be it. [680]
HELENA. (_Rises_) You have bewildered me. I should like to believe this. [681]
GALL. You are younger than we are, Miss Glory. You will live to see [682]
GALL. it. [683]
HALLEMEIER. True. (_Looking around_) Don’t you think Miss Glory might [684]
HALLEMEIER. lunch with us? (_All MEN rise._) [685]
GALL. Of course. Domin, ask her on behalf of us all. [686]
DOMIN. Miss Glory, will you do us the honor? [687]
HELENA. When you know why I’ve come? [688]
FABRY. For the League of Humanity, Miss Glory. [689]
HELENA. Oh, in that case perhaps-- [690]
FABRY. That’s fine. (_Pause_) Miss Glory, excuse me for five minutes. [691]
FABRY. {EXIT} [692]
HALLEMEIER. Thank you. [694]
HALLEMEIER. {EXIT} [695]
GALL. {EXIT} [696]
BUSMAN. (_Whispering_) I’ll be back soon. [698]
BUSMAN. {EXIT} [699]
ALQUIST. (_Starts, stops, then to HELENA, then to door_) I’ll be back [701]
ALQUIST. in exactly five minutes. [702]
ALQUIST. {EXIT} [703]
HELENA. What have they all gone for? [705]
DOMIN. To cook, Miss Glory. (_On her L._) [706]
HELENA. To cook what? [707]
DOMIN. Lunch. (_They laugh; takes her hand_) The Robots do our cooking [708]
DOMIN. for us and as they’ve no taste it’s not altogether-- (_She laughs._) [709]
DOMIN. Hallemeier is awfully _good_ at grills and Gall can make any kind of [710]
DOMIN. sauce, and Busman knows all about omelets. [711]
HELENA. What a feast! And what’s the specialty of Mr.--your builder? [712]
DOMIN. Alquist? Nothing. He only lays the table. And Fabry will get [713]
DOMIN. together a little fruit. Our cuisine is very modest, Miss Glory. [714]
HELENA. (_Thoughtfully_) I wanted to ask you something-- [715]
DOMIN. And I wanted to ask you something too--they’ll be back in five [716]
DOMIN. minutes. (_Looks at door R._) [717]
HELENA. What did you want to ask me? (_Sits C._) [718]
DOMIN. Excuse me, you asked first. (_Sits L. of her._) [719]
HELENA. Perhaps it’s silly of me, but why do you manufacture female [720]
HELENA. Robots when--when-- [721]
DOMIN. When sex means nothing to them? [722]
HELENA. Yes. [723]
DOMIN. There’s a certain demand for them, you see. Servants, [724]
DOMIN. saleswomen, stenographers. People are _used_ to it. [725]
HELENA. But--but tell me, are the Robots male and female, [726]
HELENA. mutually--completely without-- [727]
DOMIN. Completely indifferent to each other, Miss Glory. There’s no [728]
DOMIN. sign of any _affection_ between them. [729]
HELENA. Oh, that’s terrible. [730]
DOMIN. Why? [731]
HELENA. It’s so unnatural. One doesn’t know whether to be disgusted or [732]
HELENA. to hate them, or perhaps-- [733]
DOMIN. To pity them. (_Smiles._) [734]
HELENA. That’s more like it. What did you want to ask _me_? [735]
DOMIN. I should like to ask you, Miss Helena, if you will marry me. [736]
HELENA. What? (_Rises._) [737]
DOMIN. Will you be my wife? (_Rises._) [738]
HELENA. No. The idea! [739]
DOMIN. (_To her, looking at his watch_) Another three minutes. If you [740]
DOMIN. don’t marry me you’ll have to marry one of the other five. [741]
HELENA. But why should I? [742]
DOMIN. Because they’re _all_ going to ask you in turn. [743]
HELENA. (_Crossing him to L.C._) How could they dare do such a thing? [744]
DOMIN. I’m very sorry, Miss Glory. It seems they’ve fallen in love with [745]
DOMIN. you. [746]
HELENA. Please don’t let them. I’ll--I’ll go away at once. (_Starts R._) [747]
HELENA. (_He stops her, his arms up._) [748]
DOMIN. Helena-- (_She backs away to desk. He follows_) You wouldn’t be [749]
DOMIN. so cruel as to refuse us. [750]
HELENA. But, but--I can’t marry all six. [751]
DOMIN. No, but one anyhow. If you don’t want _me_, marry Fabry. [752]
HELENA. I won’t. [753]
DOMIN. Ah! Doctor Gall? [754]
HELENA. I don’t want any of you. [755]
DOMIN. Another two minutes. (_Pleading. Looking at watch._) [756]
HELENA. I think you’d marry any woman who came here. [757]
DOMIN. _Plenty_ of them have come, Helena. [758]
HELENA. (_Laughing_) Young? [759]
DOMIN. Yes. [760]
HELENA. Why didn’t you marry one of _them_? [761]
DOMIN. Because I didn’t lose my head. Until today--then as soon as you [762]
DOMIN. lifted your veil-- (_HELENA turns her head away._) Another minute. [763]
HELENA. But I don’t want you, I tell you. [764]
DOMIN. (_Laying both hands on her shoulder_) One more minute! Now you [765]
DOMIN. either have to look me straight in the eye and say “no” violently, and [766]
DOMIN. then I leave you alone--or-- (_HELENA looks at him. He takes hands_) [767]
DOMIN. (_away. She takes his hand again._) [768]
HELENA. (_Turning her head away_) You’re mad. [769]
DOMIN. A man _has_ to be a bit mad, Helena. That’s the best thing about [770]
DOMIN. him. (_He draws her to him._) [771]
HELENA. (_Not meaning it_) You are--you are-- [772]
DOMIN. Well? [773]
HELENA. Don’t, you’re hurting me! [774]
DOMIN. The last chance, Helena. Now or never-- [775]
HELENA. But--but-- (_He embraces her; kisses her. She embraces him._) [776]
HELENA. (_KNOCKING at R. door._) [777]
DOMIN. (_Releasing her_) Come in. (_She lays her head on his shoulder._) [778]
BUSMAN. {ENTER} [779]

BUSMAN. Yes. [786]
DOMIN. So have we. (_He embraces her. The MEN rush around them and offer congratulations._) [787]

HALLEMEIER. (_Putting down his flowers on L.C. table and indicates the_) [792]
HALLEMEIER. (_door R._) Still asleep? [793]
DOMIN. Yes. [794]
HALLEMEIER. Well, as long as she’s asleep she can’t worry about it. [795]
HALLEMEIER. (_He remains at L.C. table._) [796]
DOMIN. She knows nothing about it. (_At C._) [797]
FABRY. (_Putting plant on writing desk_) I certainly hope nothing [798]
FABRY. happens today. [799]
HALLEMEIER. For goodness sake drop it all. Look, this is a fine [800]
HALLEMEIER. cyclamen, isn’t it? A new sort, my latest--Cyclamen Helena. [801]
DOMIN. (_Picks up binoculars and goes out into balcony_) No signs of [802]
DOMIN. the ship. Things must be pretty bad. [803]
HALLEMEIER. Be quiet. Suppose she heard you. [804]
DOMIN. (_Coming into room, puts glasses on desk_) Well, anyway the [805]
DOMIN. _Ultimus_ arrived just in time. [806]
FABRY. You really think that today--? [807]
DOMIN. I don’t know. (_He crosses to L.C. table_) Aren’t the flowers [808]
DOMIN. fine? [809]
HALLEMEIER. (_Fondles flowers_) These are my primroses. And this [810]
HALLEMEIER. is my new jasmine. I’ve discovered a wonderful way of developing [811]
HALLEMEIER. flowers quickly. Splendid varieties, too. Next year I’ll be developing [812]
HALLEMEIER. marvelous ones. [813]
DOMIN. What next year? [814]
FABRY. I’d give a good deal to know what’s happening at Havre with-- [815]
HELENA. {ENTER} [816]
HELENA. (_Off R._) Nana. [817]
HALLEMEIER. {EXIT} [818]
FABRY. {EXIT} [819]
DOMIN. Keep quiet. She’s awake. Out you go. (_ALL go out on tiptoe_) [820]
DOMIN. (_through L.2 door. Enter NANA L.1_) [821]
DOMIN. {EXIT} [822]
NANA. {ENTER} [823]
HELENA. (_Calling from R._) Nana? [824]
NANA. Horrid mess! Pack of heathens. If I had _my_ say, I’d-- [825]
HELENA. (_Backwards in the doorway from R._) Nana, come and do up my [826]
HELENA. dress. [827]
NANA. I’m coming. So you’re up at last. (_Fastening HELENA’S dress_) My [828]
NANA. gracious, what brutes! [829]
HELENA. Who? (_Turning._) [830]
NANA. If you want to turn _around_, then turn around, but I shan’t [831]
NANA. fasten you up. [832]
HELENA. (_Turns back_) What are you grumbling about now? [833]
NANA. These dreadful creatures, these heathens-- [834]
HELENA. (_Turning toward NANA again_) The Robots? [835]
NANA. I wouldn’t even call them by name. [836]
HELENA. What’s happened? [837]
NANA. Another of them here has caught it. He began to smash up the [838]
NANA. statues and pictures in the drawing room; gnashed his teeth; foamed at [839]
NANA. the mouth. Worse than an animal. [840]
HELENA. Which of them caught it? [841]
NANA. The one--well, he hasn’t got any _Christian_ name. The one in [842]
NANA. charge of the library. [843]
HELENA. Radius? [844]
NANA. That’s him. My goodness, I’m scared of them. A spider doesn’t [845]
NANA. scare me as much as them. [846]
HELENA. But Nana, I’m surprised you’re not sorry for them. [847]
NANA. Why, you’re scared of them too. You know you are. Why else did [848]
NANA. you bring _me_ here? [849]
HELENA. I’m not scared, really I’m not, Nana. I’m only sorry for them. [850]
NANA. You’re scared. Nobody could _help_ being scared. Why, the dog’s [851]
NANA. scared of them. He won’t take a scrap of meat out of their hands. He [852]
NANA. draws in his tail and howls when he knows they’re about. [853]
HELENA. The dog has no sense. [854]
NANA. He’s better than _them_, and he knows it. Even the _horse_ shies [855]
NANA. when he meets them. They don’t have any young, and a _dog_ has young, [856]
NANA. _everyone_ has young-- [857]
HELENA. (_Turning back_) Please fasten up my dress, Nana. [858]
NANA. I say it’s against God’s will to-- [859]
HELENA. What is it that smells so nice? [860]
NANA. Flowers. [861]
HELENA. What for? [862]
NANA. Now you can turn around. [863]
HELENA. (_Turns; crosses to C._) Oh, aren’t they lovely? Look, Nana. [864]
HELENA. What’s happening today? [865]
DOMIN. {ENTER} [866]
NANA. It ought to be the end of the world. (_Enter DOMIN L.2. He_) [867]
NANA. (_crosses down front of table L.C._) [868]
HELENA. (_Crosses to him_) Oh, hello, Harry. (_NANA turns upstage to L._) [869]
HELENA. Harry, why all these flowers? [870]
DOMIN. Guess. (_This scene is played down in front of L.C. table._) [871]
HELENA. Well, it’s not my _birthday_! [872]
DOMIN. Better than that. [873]
HELENA. I don’t know. Tell me. [874]
DOMIN. It’s ten years ago _today_ since you _came_ here. [875]
HELENA. Ten years? Today? Why-- (_They embrace._) [876]
NANA. (_Muttering_) I’m off. (_She exits L.1._) [877]
NANA. {EXIT} [878]
HELENA. Fancy you remembering. [879]
DOMIN. I’m really ashamed, Helena. I didn’t. [880]
HELENA. But you-- [881]
DOMIN. _They_ remembered. [882]
HELENA. Who? [883]
DOMIN. Busman, Hallemeier--_all_ of them. Put your hand in my pocket. [884]
HELENA. (_Takes necklace from his Left jacket pocket_) Oh! Pearls! A [885]
HELENA. necklace! Harry, is this for me? [886]
DOMIN. It’s from Busman. [887]
HELENA. But we can’t accept it, can we? [888]
DOMIN. Oh, yes, we can. (_Puts necklace on table L.C._) Put your hand [889]
DOMIN. in the other pocket. [890]
HELENA. (_Takes a revolver out of his Right pocket_) What’s that? [891]
DOMIN. Sorry. Not that. Try again. (_He puts gun in pocket._) [892]
HELENA. Oh, Harry, why do you carry a revolver? [893]
DOMIN. It got there by mistake. [894]
HELENA. You never used to _carry_ one. [895]
DOMIN. No, you’re right. (_Indicates breast pocket_) There, that’s the [896]
DOMIN. pocket. [897]
HELENA. (_Takes out cameo_) A cameo. Why, it’s a Greek cameo. [898]
DOMIN. Apparently. Anyhow, Fabry says it is. [899]
HELENA. Fabry? Did Mr. Fabry give me that? [900]
DOMIN. Of course. (_Opens the L.1 door_) And look in here. Helena, come [901]
DOMIN. and see this. (_BOTH exit L.1._) [902]
HELENA. (_Off L.1_) Oh, isn’t it fine? Is this from you? [903]
DOMIN. (_Off L.1_) No, from Alquist. And there’s another on the piano. [904]
HELENA. This must be from you? [905]
DOMIN. There’s a card on it. [906]
HELENA. From Doctor Gall. (_Reappearing in L.1 doorway_) Oh, Harry, I [907]
HELENA. feel embarrassed at so much kindness. [908]
DOMIN. (_Enters to up R. of table L.C._) Come here. This is what [909]
DOMIN. Hallemeier brought you. [910]
HELENA. (_To up L. of desk_) These beautiful flowers? [911]
DOMIN. Yes. It’s a new kind. Cyclamen-Helena. He grew them in honor of [912]
DOMIN. _you_. They are almost as beautiful as you. [913]
HELENA. (_Kissing him_) Harry, why do they all-- [914]
DOMIN. They’re awfully fond of you. I’m afraid that my present is a [915]
DOMIN. little--Look out of the window. (_Crosses to window and beckons to_) [916]
DOMIN. (_her._) [917]
HELENA. Where? (_They go out into the balcony._) [918]
DOMIN. Into the harbor. [919]
HELENA. There’s a new ship. [920]
DOMIN. That’s _your_ ship. [921]
HELENA. Mine? How do you mean? [922]
DOMIN. (_R._) For you to take trips in--for your amusement. [923]
HELENA. (_L._) Harry, that’s a gunboat. [924]
DOMIN. A gunboat? What are you thinking of? It’s only a little _bigger_ [925]
DOMIN. and more _solid_ than most ships. [926]
HELENA. Yes, but with guns. [927]
DOMIN. Oh, yes, with a few guns. You’ll travel like a _queen_, Helena. [928]
HELENA. What’s the meaning of it? Has anything happened? [929]
DOMIN. Good heavens, no. I say, try these pearls. (_Crosses to R. of_) [930]
DOMIN. (_table L.C._) [931]
HELENA. Harry, have you had bad news? [932]
DOMIN. On the contrary, no letters have arrived for a whole week. [933]
HELENA. Nor telegrams? (_Coming into the room C._) [934]
DOMIN. Nor telegrams. [935]
HELENA. What does that mean? [936]
DOMIN. _Holidays_ for us! We all sit in the office with our feet on the [937]
DOMIN. table and take a nap. No letters--no telegrams. Glorious! [938]
HELENA. Then you’ll stay with me today? [939]
DOMIN. Certainly. (_Embraces her_) That is, we will see. Do you [940]
DOMIN. remember ten years ago today? (_Crosses to L. of table L.C._) Miss [941]
DOMIN. Glory, it’s a great honor to welcome you. (_They assume the same_) [942]
DOMIN. (_positions as when they first met ten years before in DOMIN’S office._) [943]
HELENA. (_To table_) Oh, Mr. Manager, I’m so interested in your [944]
HELENA. factory. (_She sits R. of table._) [945]
DOMIN. I’m sorry, Miss Glory, it’s strictly forbidden. The manufacture [946]
DOMIN. of artificial people is a secret. [947]
HELENA. But to oblige the young lady who has come a long way. [948]
DOMIN. (_Leans on table_) Certainly, Miss Glory. I have no secrets from [949]
DOMIN. you. [950]
HELENA. Are you sure, Harry? (_Leaning on desk, seriously, his right_) [951]
HELENA. (_hand on hers._) [952]
DOMIN. _Yes._ (_They gradually draw apart._) [953]
HELENA. But I warn you, sir, this young lady intends to do terrible [954]
HELENA. things. [955]
DOMIN. Good gracious, Miss Glory. Perhaps she doesn’t want to marry me. [956]
HELENA. Heaven forbid. She never dreamt of such a thing. But she came [957]
HELENA. here intending to stir up a _revolt_ among your _Robots_. [958]
DOMIN. A revolt of the Robots! [959]
HELENA. (_Low voice_) Harry, what’s the matter with you? [960]
DOMIN. (_Laughing it off_) _A revolt of the Robots_, that’s a fine [961]
DOMIN. idea. (_Crosses to back of table. She watches him suspiciously._) Miss [962]
DOMIN. Glory, it would be easier for you to cause bolts and screws to rebel [963]
DOMIN. than our Robots. You know, Helena, you’re wonderful. You’ve turned the [964]
DOMIN. hearts of us all. (_Sits on table._) [965]
HELENA. Oh, I was fearfully impressed by you all then. You were all so [966]
HELENA. sure of yourselves, so strong. I seemed like a tiny little girl who had [967]
HELENA. lost her way among--among-- [968]
DOMIN. What? [969]
HELENA. (_Front_) Among huge trees. All my feelings were so _trifling_ [970]
HELENA. compared with your _self-confidence_. And in all these years I’ve never [971]
HELENA. _lost_ this anxiety. But you’ve never felt the _least_ misgiving, not [972]
HELENA. even when everything went wrong. [973]
DOMIN. What went wrong? [974]
HELENA. Your plans. You remember, Harry, when the workmen in America [975]
HELENA. revolted against the Robots and smashed them up, and when the people [976]
HELENA. gave the Robots firearms against the rebels. And then when the [977]
HELENA. governments turned the Robots into soldiers, and there were so many [978]
HELENA. _wars_. [979]
DOMIN. (_Getting up and walking about_) We foresaw that, Helena. [980]
DOMIN. (_Around table to R.C._) You see, these are only passing troubles [981]
DOMIN. which are bound to happen before the new conditions are _established_. [982]
DOMIN. (_Walking up and down, standing at Center._) [983]
HELENA. You were all so powerful, so overwhelming. The _whole world_ [984]
HELENA. bowed down before you. (_Rising_) Oh, Harry! (_Crosses to him._) [985]
DOMIN. What is it? [986]
HELENA. Close the factory and let’s go away. All of us. [987]
DOMIN. I say, what’s the meaning of this? [988]
HELENA. I don’t know. But can’t we go away? [989]
DOMIN. Impossible, Helena! That is, at this particular moment-- [990]
HELENA. At once, Harry. I’m so frightened. [991]
DOMIN. (_Takes her_) About what, Helena? [992]
HELENA. It’s as if something was falling on top of us, and couldn’t [993]
HELENA. be stopped. Oh, take us all away from here. We’ll find a place in the [994]
HELENA. world where there’s no one else. Alquist will build us a house, and [995]
HELENA. then we’ll begin life all over again. (_The TELEPHONE rings._) [996]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to telephone on desk up L._) Excuse me. Hello--yes, [997]
DOMIN. what? I’ll be there at once. Fabry is calling me, my dear. (_Crosses L._) [998]
HELENA. Tell me-- (_She rushes up to him._) [999]
DOMIN. Yes, when I come back. Don’t go out of the house, dear. (_Exits L.2._) [1000]
DOMIN. {EXIT} [1001]
NANA. {ENTER} [1002]
HELENA. He won’t tell me. (_NANA brings in a water carafe from L.1._) [1003]
HELENA. Nana, find me the latest newspapers. Quickly. Look in Mr. Domin’s [1004]
HELENA. bedroom. [1005]
NANA. All right. (_Crosses R._) He leaves them all over the place. [1006]
NANA. That’s how they get crumpled up. (_Continues muttering. Exits R._) [1007]
NANA. {EXIT} [1008]
HELENA. (_Looking through binoculars at the harbor_) That’s a warship. [1009]
HELENA. U-l-t-i--_Ultimus_. They’re loading. [1010]
NANA. {ENTER} [1011]
NANA. (_Enters R. with newspapers_) Here they are. See how they’re [1012]
NANA. crumpled up. [1013]
HELENA. (_Crosses down_) They’re old ones. A week old. (_Drops papers._) [1014]
HELENA. (_BOTH at front of couch. NANA sits R. of table L.C. Puts on spectacles._) [1015]
HELENA. (_Reads the newspapers._) Something’s happening, Nana. [1016]
NANA. Very likely. It always does. (_Spelling out the words_) “W-a-r in [1017]
NANA. B-a-l-k-a-n-s.” Is that far off? [1018]
HELENA. Oh, don’t read it. It’s always the same. Always wars! (_Sits on_) [1019]
HELENA. (_couch._) [1020]
NANA. What else do you _expect_? Why do you _keep_ selling thousands [1021]
NANA. and thousands of these heathens as soldiers? [1022]
HELENA. I suppose it can’t be helped, Nana. We can’t know--Domin can’t [1023]
HELENA. know what they’re to be used for. When an order comes for them he must [1024]
HELENA. just send them. [1025]
NANA. He shouldn’t make them. (_Reading from newspaper_) “The Robot [1026]
NANA. soldiers spare no-body in the occ-up-ied terr-it-ory. They have [1027]
NANA. ass-ass-ass-inat-ed ov-er sev-en hundred thous-and cit-iz-ens.” [1028]
NANA. Citizens, if you please. [1029]
HELENA. (_Rises and crosses and takes paper_) It can’t be. Let me see. [1030]
HELENA. (_Crossing to NANA_) They have assassinated over seven hundred thousand [1031]
HELENA. citizens, evidently at the order of their commander. (_Drops paper;_) [1032]
HELENA. (_crosses up C._) [1033]
NANA. (_Spelling out the words from other paper she has picked up from_) [1034]
NANA. (_the floor_) “Re-bell-ion in Ma-drid a-gainst the gov-ern-ment. Rob-ot [1035]
NANA. in-fant-ry fires on the crowd. Nine thou-sand killed and wounded.” [1036]
HELENA. Oh, stop! (_Goes up and looks toward the harbor._) [1037]
NANA. Here’s something printed in big letters. “Latest news. At Havre [1038]
NANA. the first org-an-iz-a-tion of Rob-ots has been e-stab-lished. Rob-ots [1039]
NANA. work-men, sail-ors and sold-iers have iss-ued a man-i-fest-o to all [1040]
NANA. Rob-ots through-out the world.” I don’t understand that. That’s got no [1041]
NANA. sense. Oh, good gracious, another murder. [1042]
HELENA. (_Up C._) Take those papers away now. [1043]
NANA. Wait a bit. Here’s something in still bigger type. “Stat-ist-ics [1044]
NANA. of pop-ul-a-tion.” What’s that? [1045]
HELENA. (_Coming down to NANA_) Let me see. (_Reads_) “During the past [1046]
HELENA. week there has again not been a single birth recorded.” [1047]
NANA. What’s the meaning of that? (_Drops paper._) [1048]
HELENA. Nana, no more _people_ are being born. [1049]
NANA. That’s the end, then? (_Removing spectacles_) We’re done for. [1050]
HELENA. Don’t talk like that. [1051]
NANA. No more people are being born. That’s a punishment, that’s a [1052]
NANA. punishment. [1053]
HELENA. Nana! [1054]
NANA. (_Standing up_) That’s the end of the world. (_Repeat until off._) [1055]
NANA. (_Picks paper up from floor. She exits L.1._) [1056]
NANA. {EXIT} [1057]
HELENA. (_Goes up to window_) Oh, Mr. Alquist. (_ALQUIST off L.2._) [1058]
HELENA. Will you come here? Oh, come just as you are. You look very nice in [1059]
HELENA. your mason’s overalls. (_ALQUIST enters L.2, his hands soiled with lime_) [1060]
HELENA. (_and brick dust. She goes to end of sofa and meets him C._) Dear Mr. [1061]
HELENA. Alquist, it was awfully kind of you, that lovely present. [1062]
ALQUIST. {ENTER} [1063]
ALQUIST. My hands are soiled. I’ve been _experimenting_ with that new [1064]
ALQUIST. cement. [1065]
HELENA. Never mind. Please sit down. (_Sits on couch. He sits on her L._) [1066]
HELENA. Mr. Alquist, what’s the meaning of _Ultimus_? [1067]
ALQUIST. The last. Why? [1068]
HELENA. That’s the name of my new ship. Have you seen it? Do you think [1069]
HELENA. we’re off soon--on a trip? [1070]
ALQUIST. Perhaps _very_ soon. [1071]
HELENA. All of you with me? [1072]
ALQUIST. I should like us _all_ to be there. [1073]
HELENA. What _is_ the matter? [1074]
ALQUIST. Things are just moving on. [1075]
HELENA. Dear Mr. Alquist, I know something dreadful has happened. [1076]
ALQUIST. Has your husband _told_ you anything? [1077]
HELENA. No. _Nobody_ will tell me anything. But I feel--Is anything the [1078]
HELENA. matter? [1079]
ALQUIST. Not that we’ve heard of yet. [1080]
HELENA. I feel so nervous. Don’t _you_ ever feel nervous? [1081]
ALQUIST. Well, I’m an old man, you know. I’ve got old-fashioned ways. [1082]
ALQUIST. And I’m afraid of all this progress, and these new-fangled ideas. [1083]
HELENA. Like Nana? [1084]
ALQUIST. Yes, like Nana. Has Nana got a prayer book? [1085]
HELENA. Yes, a big thick one. [1086]
ALQUIST. And has it got prayers for various occasions? Against [1087]
ALQUIST. thunderstorms? Against illness? But not against _progress_? [1088]
HELENA. I don’t think so. [1089]
ALQUIST. That’s a pity. [1090]
HELENA. Why, do you mean you’d like to pray? [1091]
ALQUIST. I _do_ pray. [1092]
HELENA. How? [1093]
ALQUIST. Something like this: “Oh, Lord, I thank thee for having given [1094]
ALQUIST. me toil; enlighten Domin and all those who are astray; destroy their [1095]
ALQUIST. work, and aid mankind to return to their labors; let them not suffer [1096]
ALQUIST. harm in soul or body; deliver us from the Robots, and protect Helena. [1097]
ALQUIST. Amen.” [1098]
HELENA. (_Touches his arm; pats it_) Mr. Alquist, are you a believer? [1099]
ALQUIST. I don’t know. I’m not quite sure. [1100]
HELENA. And yet you pray? [1101]
ALQUIST. That’s better than _worrying_ about it. [1102]
HELENA. And that’s enough for you? [1103]
ALQUIST. (_Ironically_) It _has_ to be. [1104]
HELENA. But if you thought you saw the destruction of mankind coming [1105]
HELENA. upon us-- [1106]
ALQUIST. I _do_ see it. [1107]
HELENA. You mean mankind will be destroyed? [1108]
ALQUIST. It’s bound to be unless--unless. [1109]
HELENA. What? [1110]
ALQUIST. Nothing. (_Pats her shoulder. Rises_) Goodbye. (_Exits L.2._) [1111]
ALQUIST. {EXIT} [1112]
HELENA. (_Rises. Calling_) Nana, Nana! [1113]
NANA. {ENTER} [1114]
NANA. HELENA: Is Radius still there? [1115]
NANA. (_L.C._) The one who went mad? They haven’t come for him yet. [1116]
HELENA. Is he still raving? [1117]
NANA. No. He’s tied up. [1118]
HELENA. Please bring him here. [1119]
NANA. What? [1120]
HELENA. At once, Nana. (_Exits NANA L.1. HELENA to telephone_) [1121]
NANA. {EXIT} [1122]
HELENA. Hello, Doctor Gall, please. Oh, good day, Doctor. Yes, it’s Helena. Thanks [1123]
HELENA. for your lovely present. Could you come and see me right away? It’s [1124]
HELENA. important. Thank you. [1125]
RADIUS. {ENTER} [1126]
HELENA. Poor Radius, you’ve caught it [1127]
HELENA. too? Now they’ll send you to the stamping mill. Couldn’t you control [1128]
HELENA. yourself? Why did it happen? You see, Radius, you are more intelligent [1129]
HELENA. than the rest. Doctor Gall took such trouble to make you different. [1130]
HELENA. Won’t you speak? [1131]
RADIUS. (_Looking at her_) Send me to the stamping mill. (_Open and_) [1132]
RADIUS. (_close fists._) [1133]
HELENA. But I don’t want them to kill you. What was the trouble, Radius? [1134]
RADIUS. (_Two steps toward her. Opens and closes fists_) I won’t work [1135]
RADIUS. for you. Put me into the stamping mill. [1136]
HELENA. Do you hate us? Why? [1137]
RADIUS. You are not as strong as the Robots. You are not as skillful as [1138]
RADIUS. the Robots. The Robots can do everything. You only give orders. You do [1139]
RADIUS. nothing but talk. [1140]
HELENA. But someone must give orders. [1141]
RADIUS. I don’t want a master. I know everything for myself. [1142]
HELENA. Radius! Doctor Gall gave you a better brain than the rest, [1143]
HELENA. better than ours. You are the only one of the Robots that understands [1144]
HELENA. perfectly. That’s why I had you put into the library, so that you could [1145]
HELENA. read everything, understand everything, and then, oh, Radius--I wanted [1146]
HELENA. you to show the whole world that the Robots are our equals. That’s what [1147]
HELENA. I wanted of you. [1148]
RADIUS. I don’t want a master. I want to be master over others. [1149]
HELENA. I’m sure they’d put you in charge of _many_ Robots. You would [1150]
HELENA. be a _teacher_ of the Robots. [1151]
RADIUS. I want to be master over people. (_Head up. Pride._) [1152]
HELENA. (_Staggering_) You are mad. [1153]
RADIUS. (_Head down low, crosses toward L.; opens hands_) Then send me [1154]
RADIUS. to the stamping mill. [1155]
HELENA. (_Steps to him_) Do you think we’re afraid of you? (_Rushing to_) [1156]
HELENA. (_desk and writing note._) [1157]
RADIUS. (_Turns his head uneasily_) What are you going to do? What are [1158]
RADIUS. you going to do? (_Starts for her._) [1159]
HELENA. (_Crosses to R. of him_) Radius! (_He cowers. Body sways._) [1160]
HELENA. Give this note to Mr. Domin. (_He faces her._) It asks them not to send [1161]
HELENA. you to the stamping mill. I’m sorry you hate us so. [1162]
GALL. {ENTER} [1163]
GALL. (_Enters L.2; goes to C. upstage_) You wanted me? [1164]
HELENA. (_Backs away_) It’s about Radius, Doctor. He had an attack this [1165]
HELENA. morning. He smashed the statues downstairs. [1166]
GALL. (_Looks at him_) What a pity to _lose_ him. (_At C._) [1167]
HELENA. Radius isn’t going to be put into the stamping mill. (_Stands_) [1168]
HELENA. (_to the R. of GALL._) [1169]
GALL. But every Robot after he has had an attack--it’s a strict [1170]
GALL. order. [1171]
HELENA. No matter--Radius isn’t going, if I can _prevent_ it. [1172]
GALL. But I warn you. It’s dangerous. Come here to the window, [1173]
GALL. my good fellow. Let’s have a look. Please give me a needle or a pin. [1174]
GALL. (_Crosses up R. RADIUS follows. HELENA gets a needle from work-basket_) [1175]
GALL. (_on table R._) [1176]
HELENA. What for? [1177]
GALL. A test. (_HELENA gives him the needle. GALL crosses up to_) [1178]
GALL. (_RADIUS, who faces him. Sticks it into his hand and RADIUS gives a_) [1179]
GALL. (_violent start._) _Gently, gently._ (_Opens the jacket of RADIUS and_) [1180]
GALL. (_puts his ear to his heart_) Radius, you are going into the stamping [1181]
GALL. mill, do you understand? There they’ll kill you-- (_Takes glasses off_) [1182]
GALL. (_and cleans them_) --and grind you to powder. (_RADIUS opens hands and_) [1183]
GALL. (_fingers._) That’s terribly painful. It will make you scream aloud. [1184]
GALL. (_Opens RADIUS’S eye. RADIUS trembles._) [1185]
HELENA. Doctor-- (_Standing near couch._) [1186]
GALL. No, no, Radius, I was wrong. I forgot that Madame Domin has [1187]
GALL. put in a good word for you, and you’ll be left off. (_Listens to_) [1188]
GALL. (_heart_) Ah, that _does_ make a difference. (_RADIUS relaxes. Again_) [1189]
GALL. (_listens to his heart for a reaction_) All right--you can go. [1190]
RADIUS. You do unnecessary things-- [1191]
RADIUS. {EXIT} [1192]
GALL. (_Speaks to her--very concerned_) Reaction of the pupils, [1193]
GALL. increase of sensitiveness. It wasn’t an attack characteristic of the [1194]
GALL. Robots. [1195]
HELENA. What was it, then? (_Sits in couch._) [1196]
GALL. (_C._) Heaven knows. Stubbornness, anger or revolt--I don’t [1197]
GALL. know. And his heart, too. [1198]
HELENA. What? [1199]
GALL. It was fluttering with nervousness like a _human_ heart. He [1200]
GALL. was all in a sweat with fear, and--do you know, I don’t believe the [1201]
GALL. rascal is a Robot _at all_ any longer. [1202]
HELENA. Doctor, has Radius a soul? [1203]
GALL. (_Over to couch_) He’s got something nasty. [1204]
HELENA. If you knew how he hates us. Oh, Doctor, are all your Robots [1205]
HELENA. like that? All the new ones that you began to make in a different way? [1206]
HELENA. (_She invites him to sit beside her. He sits._) [1207]
GALL. Well, some are more sensitive than others. They’re all more [1208]
GALL. human beings than Rossum’s Robots were. [1209]
HELENA. Perhaps this hatred is more like human beings, too? [1210]
GALL. That too is _progress_. [1211]
HELENA. What became of the girl you made, the one who was most like us? [1212]
GALL. Your favorite? I _kept_ her. She’s lovely, but stupid. No [1213]
GALL. good for work. [1214]
HELENA. But she’s so beautiful. [1215]
GALL. I called her “Helena.” I wanted her to resemble _you_. She is [1216]
GALL. a failure. [1217]
HELENA. In what way? [1218]
GALL. She goes about as if in a dream, remote and listless. She’s [1219]
GALL. without life. I watch and wait for a miracle to happen. Sometimes I [1220]
GALL. think to myself: “If you were to wake up only for a moment you would [1221]
GALL. _kill_ me for having _made_ you.” [1222]
HELENA. And yet you go _on_ making Robots! Why are no more children [1223]
HELENA. being born? [1224]
GALL. We don’t know. [1225]
HELENA. Oh, but you must. Tell me. [1226]
GALL. You see, so many Robots are being manufactured that people [1227]
GALL. are becoming superfluous. Man is really a survival, but that he should [1228]
GALL. die out, after a paltry thirty years of competition, that’s the awful [1229]
GALL. part of it. You might almost think that Nature was _offended_ at the [1230]
GALL. manufacture of the Robots, but we still have old Rossum’s manuscript. [1231]
HELENA. Yes. In that strong box. [1232]
GALL. We go on using it and making Robots. All the universities are [1233]
GALL. sending in long petitions to restrict their production. Otherwise, they [1234]
GALL. say, mankind will become extinct through lack of fertility. But the R. U. R. [1235]
GALL. shareholders, of course, won’t hear of it. All the governments, [1236]
GALL. on the other hand, are clamoring for an increase in production, to [1237]
GALL. raise the standards of their armies. And all the manufacturers in the [1238]
GALL. world are ordering Robots like mad. [1239]
HELENA. And has no one demanded that the manufacture should cease [1240]
HELENA. altogether? [1241]
GALL. No one has courage. [1242]
HELENA. Courage! [1243]
GALL. People would stone him to death. You see, after all, it’s [1244]
GALL. more convenient to get your work done by the Robots. [1245]
HELENA. Oh, Doctor, what’s going to become of people? [1246]
GALL. God knows. Madame Helena, it looks to us scientists like the [1247]
GALL. end. [1248]
HELENA. (_She looks out front. Rising_) Thank you for coming and [1249]
HELENA. telling me. [1250]
GALL. (_Rises_) That means that you’re sending me away. [1251]
HELENA. Yes. [1252]
GALL. {EXIT} [1253]
HELENA. (_She crosses to L.C. To door L.1. With_) [1254]
HELENA. (_sudden resolution_) Nana! Nana! the fire, light it quickly. [1255]
NANA. {ENTER} [1256]
NANA. (_Entering L.1_) What, light the fire in the summer? [1257]
HELENA. (_Off R._) Yes! [1258]
NANA. (_She looks for RADIUS_) Has that mad _Radius_ gone?--A fire [1259]
NANA. in summer, what an idea? Nobody would think she’d been _married_ ten [1260]
NANA. years. She’s like a baby, no sense at all. A fire in summer. Like a [1261]
NANA. baby. (_She lights the fire._) [1262]
HELENA. (_Returns from R. with armful of faded papers. Back of couch_) [1263]
HELENA. (_to fireplace, L. of NANA_) Is it burning, Nana? All this has got to be [1264]
HELENA. burned. [1265]
NANA. What’s that? [1266]
HELENA. Old papers, fearfully old. Nana, shall I burn them? [1267]
NANA. Are they any use? [1268]
HELENA. _No._ [1269]
NANA. Well, then, burn them. [1270]
HELENA. (_Throwing the first sheet on the fire_) What would you say, [1271]
HELENA. Nana, if this was money and a lot of money? And if it was an invention, [1272]
HELENA. the greatest invention in the world? [1273]
NANA. (_R. of fireplace_) I’d say burn it. All these new-fangled things [1274]
NANA. are an offense to the Lord. It’s downright wickedness. Wanting to [1275]
NANA. improve the world after He has made it. [1276]
HELENA. Look how they curl up. As if they were alive. Oh, Nana, how [1277]
HELENA. horrible! [1278]
NANA. Here, let me burn them. [1279]
HELENA. (_Drawing back_) No, no, I must do it myself. Just look at the [1280]
HELENA. flames. They are like hands, like tongues, like living shapes. (_Raking_) [1281]
HELENA. (_fire with the poker_) Lie down, lie down. [1282]
NANA. That’s the end of them. (_Fireplace slowly out._) [1283]
HELENA. Nana, Nana! [1284]
NANA. Good gracious, what is it you’ve burned? (_Almost to herself._) [1285]
HELENA. Whatever have I done? [1286]
NANA. Well, what is it? (_MEN’S laughter off L.2._) [1287]
HELENA. Go quickly. It’s the gentlemen calling. [1288]
NANA. Good gracious, what a place! (_Exits L.1._) [1289]
NANA. {EXIT} [1290]
DOMIN. {ENTER} [1291]
DOMIN. (_Opens door L.2_) Come along and offer your congratulations. [1292]
HALLEMEIER. {ENTER} [1293]
GALL. {ENTER} [1294]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to R.C._) Madame Helena, I congratulate you on [1295]
HALLEMEIER. this festive day. [1296]
HELENA. Thank you. (_Coming to C._) Where are Fabry and Busman? [1297]
DOMIN. They’ve gone down the harbor. (_Closes the door and comes to C._) [1298]
HALLEMEIER. Friends, we must _drink_ to this happy occasion. [1299]
HELENA. (_Crosses L._) Brandy? With soda water? (_Exits L.1._) [1300]
HELENA. {EXIT} [1301]
HALLEMEIER. Let’s be temperate. No soda. [1302]
DOMIN. What’s been burning here? Well, shall I tell her about it? [1303]
GALL. (_L.C._) Of course. It’s all over now. [1304]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to DOMIN. Embracing DOMIN_) It’s all over now. [1305]
HALLEMEIER. It’s all over now. (_They dance around GALL in a circle._) It’s all [1306]
HALLEMEIER. over now. [1307]
DOMIN. (_In unison_) It’s all over now. (_They keep repeating. Keep it_) [1308]
DOMIN. (_after HELENA is on._) [1309]
HELENA. {ENTER} [1310]
HELENA. (_Entering L.1 with decanter and glasses_) What’s all over now? [1311]
HELENA. What’s the matter with you all? (_She puts tray on L.C. table. GALL_) [1312]
HELENA. (_helps her to pour the drinks._) [1313]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to back of table_) A piece of good luck. Madame [1314]
HALLEMEIER. Domin! (_ALL ad lib._) Just ten years ago today you arrived on this [1315]
HALLEMEIER. island. (_HALLEMEIER crosses to table for drink._) [1316]
GALL. And now, ten years later to the minute-- (_Crosses to L. of HALLEMEIER._) [1317]
HALLEMEIER. The same ship’s returning to us. So here’s to luck. [1318]
HALLEMEIER. (_Drinks. DOMIN with great exuberance has gone out in the balcony and_) [1319]
HALLEMEIER. (_looks over the harbor._) [1320]
GALL. Madame, your health. (_ALL drink._) [1321]
HALLEMEIER. That’s fine and strong. [1322]
HELENA. Which ship did you mean? [1323]
DOMIN. (_Crosses down to C. HELENA gives him his drink and she crosses_) [1324]
DOMIN. (_to front of couch_) Any ship will do, as long as it arrives in time. To [1325]
DOMIN. the ship. (_Empties his glass._) [1326]
HELENA. You’ve been waiting for the ship? (_Sits on couch._) [1327]
HALLEMEIER. Rather. Like Robinson Crusoe. Madame Helena, best wishes. [1328]
HALLEMEIER. Come along, Domin, out with the news. (_GALL has sat L. of L.C. table,_) [1329]
HALLEMEIER. (_drinking. HALLEMEIER back of table R.C._) [1330]
HELENA. Do tell me what’s happened? [1331]
DOMIN. First, it’s all up. (_He puts brandy glass on L.C. table._) [1332]
DOMIN. (_HALLEMEIER sits on table, upper end._) [1333]
HELENA. What’s up? [1334]
DOMIN. The revolt. [1335]
HELENA. What revolt? [1336]
DOMIN. Give me that paper, Hallemeier. (_HALLEMEIER hands paper. DOMIN_) [1337]
DOMIN. (_reads_) “The first National Robot organization has been founded at [1338]
DOMIN. Havre, and has issued an appeal to the Robots throughout the world.” [1339]
HELENA. I read that. [1340]
DOMIN. That means a revolution. A revolution of all the Robots in the [1341]
DOMIN. world. [1342]
HALLEMEIER. By Jove, I’d like to know-- [1343]
DOMIN. (_C._) Who started it? So would I. There was nobody in the world [1344]
DOMIN. who could affect the Robots, no agitator, no one, and suddenly this [1345]
DOMIN. happens, if you please. [1346]
HELENA. What did they do? [1347]
DOMIN. They got possession of all firearms, telegraphs, radio stations, [1348]
DOMIN. railways and ships. [1349]
HALLEMEIER. And don’t forget that these rascals outnumbered us by at [1350]
HALLEMEIER. least a thousand to one. A hundredth _part_ of them would be enough to [1351]
HALLEMEIER. _settle_ us. [1352]
DOMIN. Remember that this news was brought by the last steamer. That [1353]
DOMIN. explains the stoppage of all communication, and the arrival of no more [1354]
DOMIN. ships. We knocked off work a few days ago, and we’re just waiting to [1355]
DOMIN. see when things are to start _afresh_. [1356]
HELENA. Is that why you gave me a warship? (_GALL fills DOMIN’S glass._) [1357]
DOMIN. Oh, no, my dear, I ordered that six months ago. Just to be sure [1358]
DOMIN. I was on the safe side. But, upon my soul, I was sure then that we’d [1359]
DOMIN. be on board today. [1360]
HELENA. Why six months ago? [1361]
DOMIN. Well, there were _signs_, you know. But that’s of no [1362]
DOMIN. consequence. (_Gets glass_) To think that this week the whole of [1363]
DOMIN. civilization has been at _stake_. Your health, my friends. [1364]
HALLEMEIER. Your health, Madame Helena. (_ALL drink to HELENA._) [1365]
HELENA. You say it’s all over? [1366]
DOMIN. Absolutely. [1367]
HELENA. How do you know? [1368]
GALL. The boat’s coming in. The regular mail boat, exact to the [1369]
GALL. minute by the timetable. It will dock punctually at eleven-thirty. [1370]
DOMIN. Punctuality is a fine thing, my friends. That’s what keeps the [1371]
DOMIN. world in order. Here’s to punctuality. (_MEN drink._) [1372]
HELENA. Then--everything--is all right? [1373]
DOMIN. (_Up C. a step_) Practically everything. I believe they’ve cut [1374]
DOMIN. the cables and seized the radio station. But it doesn’t matter if only [1375]
DOMIN. the _timetable_ holds good. (_Up to window._) [1376]
HALLEMEIER. (_Rises_) If the _timetable_ holds good, human laws hold [1377]
HALLEMEIER. good. Divine laws hold good, the laws of the _universe_ hold good, [1378]
HALLEMEIER. everything holds good that _ought_ to hold good. (_GALL applauds._) [1379]
HALLEMEIER. The timetable is more significant than the gospel, more than Homer, [1380]
HALLEMEIER. more than the whole of _Kant_. Madame Helena, the timetable is the [1381]
HALLEMEIER. most perfect product of the human mind. Madame Helena, I’ll fill up my [1382]
HALLEMEIER. glass. (_GALL hands HALLEMEIER the decanter._) [1383]
HELENA. Why didn’t you tell me anything about it? [1384]
GALL. Heaven forbid. [1385]
DOMIN. You mustn’t be worried with such things. (_Glass on table R.C.;_) [1386]
DOMIN. (_crosses to back of couch._) [1387]
HELENA. But if the revolution had spread as far as here? [1388]
DOMIN. You wouldn’t know anything about it. [1389]
HELENA. Why? [1390]
DOMIN. Because we’d be on board your _Ultimus_ and well out at sea. [1391]
DOMIN. Within a month, Helena, we’d be dictating our own terms to the Robots. [1392]
HELENA. I don’t understand. [1393]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to C. toward GALL and HALLEMEIER_) We’d take something [1394]
DOMIN. with us that the Robots could not exist _without_! [1395]
HELENA. What, Harry? [1396]
DOMIN. (_Turns to HALLEMEIER_) The secret of their manufacture. Old [1397]
DOMIN. Rossum’s manuscript. As soon as they found out that they couldn’t [1398]
DOMIN. _make_ themselves they’d be on their knees to us. [1399]
GALL. (_Rises_) Madame Domin, that was our trump card. I never had [1400]
GALL. the least fear the Robots would win. How could they against people like [1401]
GALL. us? (_Up to window. GALL rises and goes out into the balcony._) [1402]
HELENA. Why didn’t you tell me? (_She rushes up to the fireplace and_) [1403]
HELENA. (_sees the ashes._) [1404]
GALL. Why, the boat’s in! [1405]
HALLEMEIER. Eleven-thirty to the dot. (_Rising and going onto the_) [1406]
HALLEMEIER. (_balcony_) The _good old Amelia_ that brought Madame Helena to us. [1407]
HALLEMEIER. (_DOMIN goes out onto the balcony._) [1408]
GALL. Just ten years ago to the minute. [1409]
HALLEMEIER. They’re throwing out the mailbags. [1410]
DOMIN. Busman’s waiting for them. And Fabry will bring us the first [1411]
DOMIN. news. You know, Helena, I’m fearfully curious to know how they-- [1412]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to C. She gets away from fire to L. of couch_) --tackled this [1413]
DOMIN. business in Europe. [1414]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses down to table_) To think we weren’t in it, we who [1415]
HALLEMEIER. invented the Robots! (_Returning to the armchair._) [1416]
HELENA. Harry-- (_Rushing to DOMIN from fireplace._) [1417]
DOMIN. What is it? [1418]
HELENA. Let’s leave here. [1419]
DOMIN. Now, Helena? Oh, come, come. [1420]
HELENA. As quickly as possible, all of us! [1421]
DOMIN. Why? [1422]
HELENA. Please, Harry. Please, Doctor Gall, Hallemeier, please close [1423]
HELENA. the factory. [1424]
DOMIN. Why, none of us could leave here now. [1425]
HELENA. Why? [1426]
DOMIN. Because we’re about to _extend_ the manufacture of the Robots. [1427]
HELENA. What, now, now after the revolt? [1428]
DOMIN. Yes, precisely, after the revolt. We’re just beginning the [1429]
DOMIN. manufacture of a new kind. [1430]
HELENA. What kind? [1431]
DOMIN. Henceforward we shan’t have just one factory. There won’t [1432]
DOMIN. be _Universal_ Robots any more. We’ll establish a factory in every [1433]
DOMIN. country, in every state, and do you know what these new factories will [1434]
DOMIN. make? [1435]
HELENA. No, what? [1436]
DOMIN. _National_ Robots. [1437]
HELENA. How do you mean? [1438]
DOMIN. I mean that each of these factories will produce Robots of a [1439]
DOMIN. different color, a different language. They’ll be complete strangers to [1440]
DOMIN. each other. (_Turns; takes in HALLEMEIER and GALL_) They’ll never be [1441]
DOMIN. able to understand each other. Then we’ll egg them on a little in the [1442]
DOMIN. matter of misunderstanding and the result will be that for ages to come [1443]
DOMIN. every Robot will hate every other Robot of a different factory mark. [1444]
DOMIN. _So humanity will be safe._ [1445]
HALLEMEIER. (_To each of them_) By Jove, we’ll make Negro Robots and [1446]
HALLEMEIER. Swedish Robots and Czechoslovakian Robots, and then-- [1447]
HELENA. Harry, that’s dreadful. [1448]
HALLEMEIER. Madame Domin, here’s to the hundred new factories. The [1449]
HALLEMEIER. _National_ Robots. (_GALL back of table L.C._) [1450]
DOMIN. Helena, mankind can only keep things going for another hundred [1451]
DOMIN. years at the outside. For a hundred years man _must_ be allowed to [1452]
DOMIN. develop and achieve the most he can. [1453]
HELENA. Oh, _close_ the factory before it’s too late. [1454]
DOMIN. I tell you we are just beginning on a bigger scale than ever. [1455]
DOMIN. (_Enter FABRY L.2; goes to L. of DOMIN._) [1456]
FABRY. {ENTER} [1457]
GALL. Well, Fabry? [1458]
DOMIN. What’s happened? Have you been down to the boat? [1459]
GALL. Let’s hear. [1460]
FABRY. Read that, Domin. (_He hands him a pink handbill. When DOMIN_) [1461]
FABRY. (_receives the handbill he sees at once that something has happened._) [1462]
HALLEMEIER. Tell us, Fabry. [1463]
FABRY. (_Falsely_) Well, everything is all right--comparatively. (_To_) [1464]
FABRY. (_the other MEN_) On the whole, much as we expected. [1465]
GALL. They acquitted themselves splendidly. [1466]
FABRY. Who? [1467]
GALL. The _people_. [1468]
FABRY. (_Hesitating_) Oh, yes, of course. That is--Excuse me, there is [1469]
FABRY. something we ought to discuss alone. [1470]
HELENA. (_Touches his arm_) Fabry, have you had bad news? [1471]
FABRY. No, no, on the contrary. I only think that we better go into the [1472]
FABRY. office. [1473]
HELENA. Stay here. I’ll go. (_Exits L.1._) [1474]
HELENA. {EXIT} [1475]
GALL. What’s happened? [1476]
DOMIN. Damnation! (_Coming down to R.C._) [1477]
FABRY. Bear in mind that the _Amelia_ brought whole bales of these [1478]
FABRY. leaflets. No other cargo at all. (_GALL closes the door L.2._) [1479]
HALLEMEIER. What? But it arrived on the minute. [1480]
FABRY. The Robots are great on punctuality. _Read it_, Domin. [1481]
DOMIN. (_R.C. Reads handbill_) “Robots throughout the world. We, the [1482]
DOMIN. first International organization of Rossum’s Universal Robots, proclaim [1483]
DOMIN. man our enemy, and an outlaw in the universe.” Good heavens, who [1484]
DOMIN. _taught_ them these phrases? [1485]
GALL. Go on. [1486]
DOMIN. They say they are more highly developed than man; stronger and [1487]
DOMIN. more intelligent. The man’s their parasite. Why, it’s absurd. [1488]
FABRY. Read the third paragraph. [1489]
DOMIN. “Robots throughout the world, we command you to kill all [1490]
DOMIN. mankind. Spare no man. Spare no woman. Save factories, railways, [1491]
DOMIN. machinery, mines and raw materials. Destroy the rest. Then return to [1492]
DOMIN. work. Work must not be stopped.” (_Looks at OTHERS._) [1493]
GALL. That’s ghastly. [1494]
HALLEMEIER. The devil! [1495]
DOMIN. “These orders are to be carried out as soon as received.” Then [1496]
DOMIN. come the detailed instructions. Is this actually being _done_, Fabry? [1497]
BUSMAN. {ENTER} [1498]
FABRY. Evidently. (_BUSMAN rushes in L.2 and collapses on couch R.C._) [1499]
FABRY. By Jove, that was a sprint! [1500]
BUSMAN. Well, boys, I suppose you’ve heard the glad news. [1501]
DOMIN. Quick on board the _Ultimus_. [1502]
BUSMAN. Wait, Harry, wait. There’s no hurry. [1503]
DOMIN. Why wait? [1504]
BUSMAN. Because it’s no good, my boy. The Robots are already on board [1505]
BUSMAN. the _Ultimus_. [1506]
GALL. That’s ugly. [1507]
DOMIN. Fabry, telephone the electrical works. (_FABRY goes to back of_) [1508]
DOMIN. (_couch._) [1509]
BUSMAN. No use, my boy. They’ve charged the air with static. [1510]
DOMIN. (_Inspects his revolver_) Well, then, I’ll _go_. (_Starts L.;_) [1511]
DOMIN. (_stops._) [1512]
BUSMAN. Where? [1513]
DOMIN. To the electrical works. There are some _people_ still there. [1514]
DOMIN. I’ll bring them across. (_Gets as far as L.2 door._) [1515]
BUSMAN. Better not try it. [1516]
DOMIN. Why? [1517]
BUSMAN. Because I’m very much afraid we are surrounded. (_ALL rush out_) [1518]
BUSMAN. (_into the balcony._) [1519]
GALL. Surrounded? (_Runs to window_) I rather think you’re right. [1520]
GALL. (_GALL rushes to balcony._) [1521]
HALLEMEIER. By Jove, that’s deuced quick work. (_Going to windows._) [1522]
HELENA. {ENTER} [1523]
HELENA. (_Runs in L.1. To L._) Harry, what’s this? (_Holds out paper._) [1524]
DOMIN. Where did you get it? (_Coming to C._) [1525]
HELENA. (_Points to the manifesto of the ROBOTS which she has in her_) [1526]
HELENA. (_hand_) The Robots in the kitchen! [1527]
DOMIN. Where are the ones that brought it? [1528]
HELENA. There, gathered around the house. (_GALL, HALLEMEIER, DOMIN_) [1529]
HELENA. (_start down C._) [1530]
HELENA. (_The factory WHISTLE blows. MOB VOICES start._) [1531]
DOMIN. The factory whistle! (_FABRY, GALL, HALLEMEIER looking over C.;_) [1532]
DOMIN. (_then turn R._) [1533]
BUSMAN. Noon? [1534]
DOMIN. (_Looking at his watch. To HALLEMEIER_) No! That’s not noon yet. [1535]
DOMIN. That must be--that’s-- (_Front._) [1536]
HELENA. What? [1537]
DOMIN. The Robots’ signal--the attack! [1538]
DIRECTOR. ACT 3 [1539]
ALQUIST. {ENTER} [1540]
GALL. {ENTER} [1541]
DOMIN. {ENTER} [1542]
DOMIN. (_Gets binoculars from desk; crosses up to window. To GALL_) Any [1543]
DOMIN. more of them? [1544]
GALL. Yes. There standing like a wall, beyond the garden railing. [1545]
GALL. Why are they so quiet? It’s monstrous to be besieged with silence. [1546]
DOMIN. (_Looking through the barred windows_) I should like to know [1547]
DOMIN. what they are waiting for? They must make a start any minute now. If [1548]
DOMIN. they lean against the railings it will snap like a match. [1549]
GALL. They aren’t armed. [1550]
DOMIN. (_Puzzled_) We couldn’t hold our own for five minutes. Man [1551]
DOMIN. alive, they overwhelm us like an avalanche. Why don’t they make a rush [1552]
DOMIN. for it? I say. (_Turns to GALL._) [1553]
GALL. Well? [1554]
DOMIN. I’d like to know what will become of us in the next ten minutes. [1555]
DOMIN. They’ve got us in a vise. We’re done for, Gall. [1556]
GALL. You know, we made one serious mistake. [1557]
DOMIN. What? [1558]
GALL. We made the Robots’ faces too much alike. A hundred thousand [1559]
GALL. faces all alike, all facing this way. A hundred thousand expressionless [1560]
GALL. bubbles. It’s like a nightmare. [1561]
DOMIN. You think if they’d been different-- [1562]
GALL. It wouldn’t have been such an awful sight! [1563]
DOMIN. (_Looks through binoculars towards the harbor_) I’d like to know [1564]
DOMIN. what they’re unloading from the _Amelia_. [1565]
GALL. Not firearms. [1566]
FABRY. {ENTER} [1567]
HALLEMEIER. {ENTER} [1568]
FABRY. (_Enters L.2 with a plug-box to which is attached a long cable_) [1569]
FABRY. (_or wire. HALLEMEIER following him. FABRY attaches the cable to an_) [1570]
FABRY. (_electric installation which is on the floor near the wall, down stage_) [1571]
FABRY. (_at L.1 entrance_) All right, Hallemeier, lay down that wire. [1572]
HALLEMEIER. (_Just inside the room_) That was a bit of work. What’s the [1573]
HALLEMEIER. news? (_Seeing DOMIN and GALL at the window._) [1574]
GALL. We’re completely surrounded. [1575]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to window_) We’ve barricaded the passages and [1576]
HALLEMEIER. the stairs. (_Going to window_) God, what swarms of them. I don’t like [1577]
HALLEMEIER. the looks of them, Domin. There’s a feeling of death about it all. Any [1578]
HALLEMEIER. water here? [1579]
FABRY. Ready! [1580]
GALL. (_Turning round in the chair_) What’s that wire for, Fabry? [1581]
FABRY. The electrical installation. Now we can run the current all [1582]
FABRY. along the garden railing. (_Up to window_) Whenever we like. If anyone [1583]
FABRY. touches it he’ll know it. We’ve still got some _people_ there anyhow. [1584]
GALL. Where? [1585]
FABRY. In the electrical works. At least, I hope so. (_Goes to lamp on_) [1586]
FABRY. (_table L.C. and turns on lamp_) Ah, they’re there, and they’re working. [1587]
FABRY. As long as that’ll burn we’re all right. (_To window._) [1588]
HALLEMEIER. The barricades are _all right_, too, Fabry. [1589]
FABRY. _Your_ barricades! I can put twelve hundred volts into that [1590]
FABRY. railing. (_HELENA is playing Rachmaninoff’s Elegie off L.1._) [1591]
DOMIN. Where’s Busman? (_DOMIN has left window and is walking up and_) [1592]
DOMIN. (_down stage across front._) [1593]
FABRY. Downstairs in the office. He’s working out some calculations. [1594]
DOMIN. I’ve called him. We must have a conference. (_Crosses to L._) [1595]
ALQUIST. Thank God Madame Helena can still play. (_HALLEMEIER crosses to L.1 door, opens it slightly and listens to music. Enter BUSMAN L.2._) [1596]
BUSMAN. {ENTER} [1597]
FABRY. Look out, Bus--look out for the wires. [1598]
GALL. What’s that you’re carrying? [1599]
BUSMAN. (_Laying the books on the table L.C._) The ledger, my boy. I’d [1600]
BUSMAN. like to wind up the accounts before--before-- (_DOMIN crosses up to_) [1601]
BUSMAN. (_window._) Well, this time I shan’t wait till the New Year to strike a [1602]
BUSMAN. balance. What’s up? (_Goes to window_) Absolutely quiet. [1603]
GALL. Can’t you see anything? [1604]
BUSMAN. Nothing but blue--blue everywhere. [1605]
GALL. That’s the Robots. [1606]
DOMIN. The Robots are unloading _firearms_ from the _Amelia_. [1607]
BUSMAN. Well, what of it? How can I _stop_ them? (_Returns to L.C._) [1608]
BUSMAN. (_table, sits and opens ledger._) [1609]
DOMIN. We can’t stop them. [1610]
BUSMAN. Then let me go on with my accounts. (_Goes on with his work._) [1611]
DOMIN. (_Picks up telescope_) Good God! The _Ultimus_ has trained her [1612]
DOMIN. guns on us. [1613]
GALL. Who’s _done that_? [1614]
DOMIN. The Robots on board. [1615]
FABRY. H’m, then of course-- (_Pause_) Then--then that’s the end of us. [1616]
FABRY. (_To R. corner of desk._) [1617]
GALL. You mean? [1618]
FABRY. The Robots are practised marksmen. [1619]
DOMIN. Yes. It’s inevitable. (_Pause._) [1620]
GALL. (_Swinging around; looking into room. Pause_) That was [1621]
GALL. criminal of old Europe to teach the Robots to fight. Damn them. [1622]
GALL. Couldn’t they have given us a rest with their politics? It was a crime [1623]
GALL. to make soldiers of them. [1624]
ALQUIST. It was a crime to make Robots. [1625]
DOMIN. (_Quietly. Down C._) No, Alquist, I don’t regret that even today. [1626]
ALQUIST. Not even today? [1627]
DOMIN. (_Dreamily_) Not even today, the last day of civilization. It [1628]
DOMIN. was a colossal achievement. [1629]
BUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Three hundred sixty million. [1630]
DOMIN. (_From window_) Alquist, this is our last hour. We are already [1631]
DOMIN. speaking half in the other world. That was not an evil _dream_ to [1632]
DOMIN. shatter the servitude of labor. The dreadful and humiliating _labor_ [1633]
DOMIN. that man had to undergo. Work was too hard. _Life_ was too hard. And to [1634]
DOMIN. overcome that-- [1635]
ALQUIST. Was not what the two Rossums dreamed of. Old Rossum only [1636]
ALQUIST. thought of his Godless tricks, and the young one of his milliards. And [1637]
ALQUIST. that’s not what your R. U. R. _shareholders_ dream of either. They [1638]
ALQUIST. dream of dividends, and their dividends are the ruin of mankind. [1639]
DOMIN. To Hell with your dividends. (_Crossing R. in front of couch_) [1640]
DOMIN. Do you suppose I’d have done an hour’s work for them? It was for myself [1641]
DOMIN. that I worked, for my own satisfaction. I wanted man to become the [1642]
DOMIN. master. So that he _shouldn’t_ live merely for the crust of bread. I [1643]
DOMIN. wanted not a single soul to be broken by other people’s machinery. I [1644]
DOMIN. wanted nothing, nothing, nothing to be left of this appalling social [1645]
DOMIN. structure. I’m revolted by poverty. I wanted a new generation. I [1646]
DOMIN. wanted--I thought-- [1647]
ALQUIST. Well? [1648]
DOMIN. (_Front of couch_) I wanted to turn the whole of mankind into [1649]
DOMIN. an aristocracy of the world. An aristocracy nourished by millions of [1650]
DOMIN. mechanical slaves. Unrestricted, free and consummated in man. And maybe [1651]
DOMIN. more than man. [1652]
ALQUIST. Superman? [1653]
DOMIN. Yes. Oh, only to have a hundred years of time. Another hundred [1654]
DOMIN. years for the future of mankind. [1655]
BUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Carried forward--four hundred and twenty [1656]
BUSMAN. millions. (_DOMIN sits on couch._) [1657]
HALLEMEIER. (_Pauses--back of couch_) What a fine thing music is. We [1658]
HALLEMEIER. ought to have gone in for that before. [1659]
FABRY. Gone in for what? [1660]
HALLEMEIER. Beauty, lovely things. What a lot of lovely things there [1661]
HALLEMEIER. are. The world was wonderful, and we--we here--tell me, what enjoyment [1662]
HALLEMEIER. did we _have_? [1663]
BUSMAN. (_Sotto voce_) Five hundred and twenty million. [1664]
HALLEMEIER. Life was a good thing, life was-- (_Looking out of window._) [1665]
HALLEMEIER. (_Directly to FABRY_) Fabry, switch the current into that railing. [1666]
FABRY. Why? (_Rushes to electric installation at L._) [1667]
HALLEMEIER. They’re grabbing hold of it. (_DOMIN rises--straightens up._) [1668]
HALLEMEIER. (_ALL rise._) [1669]
GALL. Connect it up. [1670]
HALLEMEIER. Fine, that’s doubled them up. Two, three, four killed. [1671]
GALL. They’re retreating. (_DOMIN sits._) [1672]
HALLEMEIER. Five killed. [1673]
HALLEMEIER. GALL (_Pause_) The first encounter. [1674]
HALLEMEIER. They’re charred to cinders, my boy. Who says we must give [1675]
HALLEMEIER. in? (_MUSIC stops._) [1676]
DOMIN. (_ALQUIST and GALL sit. Wiping his forehead_) Perhaps we’ve been [1677]
DOMIN. killed this hundred years and are only ghosts. It’s as if I had been [1678]
DOMIN. through all this before, as if I’d already had a mortal wound here [1679]
DOMIN. in the throat. (_Looking at each as he speaks_) And you, Fabry, had [1680]
DOMIN. once been shot in the head. And you, Gall, torn limb from limb. And [1681]
DOMIN. Hallemeier knifed. [1682]
HALLEMEIER. Fancy me being knifed. (_Looks at each. Then speaks_) Why [1683]
HALLEMEIER. are you so quiet, you fools? (_Steps down_) Speak, can’t you? [1684]
ALQUIST. And who is to blame for all this? [1685]
HALLEMEIER. Nobody is to blame except the Robots. [1686]
ALQUIST. No, it is _we_ are to blame. You, Domin, myself--all of us. [1687]
ALQUIST. For our own selfish ends, for profit, for progress, we have destroyed [1688]
ALQUIST. mankind. Now we’ll _burst_ with all our greatness. [1689]
HALLEMEIER. Rubbish, man. Mankind can’t be wiped out so easily. [1690]
ALQUIST. It’s our fault. It’s our fault. (_Rises, coming R. of GALL._) [1691]
GALL. No! I’m to blame for this, for everything that’s happened. [1692]
GALL. (_He leaves the window and comes down to end of couch._) [1693]
FABRY. You, Gall? [1694]
GALL. I changed the Robots. [1695]
BUSMAN. What’s that? [1696]
GALL. I changed the character of the Robots. I changed the way of [1697]
GALL. making them. Just a few details about their bodies. Chiefly--chiefly, [1698]
GALL. their--their irritability. [1699]
HALLEMEIER. Damn it, why? [1700]
BUSMAN. What did you do it for? [1701]
FABRY. Why didn’t you say anything? [1702]
GALL. I did it in secret. I was transforming them into human [1703]
GALL. beings. In certain respects they’re already _above_ us. They’re [1704]
GALL. stronger than we are. [1705]
FABRY. And what’s that got to do with the revolt of the Robots? [1706]
GALL. Everything, in my opinion. They’ve ceased to be machines. [1707]
GALL. They’re already _aware_ of their _superiority_, and they hate us as [1708]
GALL. they hate everything human. [1709]
DOMIN. Perhaps we’re only phantoms. [1710]
FABRY. Stop, Harry. We haven’t much time, Doctor Gall. [1711]
DOMIN. Fabry, Fabry, how your forehead bleeds where the shot pierced it. [1712]
FABRY. (_Crosses to GALL_) Be silent! Doctor Gall, you admit changing [1713]
FABRY. the way of making the Robots. [1714]
GALL. Yes. [1715]
FABRY. Were you aware of what might be the consequences of your [1716]
FABRY. experiment? [1717]
GALL. I was bound to reckon with such a possibility. [1718]
FABRY. (_Amusing_) Why did you do it, then? [1719]
HELENA. {ENTER} [1720]
GALL. For my own satisfaction. The experiment was my own. [1721]
HELENA. That’s not true, Doctor Gall! (_Crosses to couch._) [1722]
DOMIN. (_Rises_) Helena, you? (_Crosses to her_) Let’s look at you. Oh, [1723]
DOMIN. it’s terrible to be dead. (_He rises and crushes her in his arms._) [1724]
HELENA. Stop, Harry. [1725]
DOMIN. No, no, Helena, don’t leave me now. You are _life_ itself. [1726]
HELENA. No, dear, I won’t leave you. But I must tell them. Doctor Gall [1727]
HELENA. is not guilty. [1728]
FABRY. Excuse me. Gall was under certain obligations. [1729]
HELENA. No. He did it because I wanted it. Tell them, Doctor Gall--how [1730]
HELENA. many years ago did I ask you to--? [1731]
GALL. I did it on my own responsibility. [1732]
HELENA. Don’t believe him. I asked him to give the Robots souls. [1733]
DOMIN. This has nothing to do with the soul. [1734]
HELENA. That’s what he said. He said that he could change only a [1735]
HELENA. physiological--a physiological-- [1736]
HALLEMEIER. (_From up at window_) A physiological correlate? [1737]
HELENA. Yes. But it meant so much to me that he should do even that. [1738]
DOMIN. Why? [1739]
HELENA. I thought that if they were more like us they would understand [1740]
HELENA. us better. That they couldn’t hate us if they were only a little more [1741]
HELENA. human. [1742]
DOMIN. Nobody can hate man more than man. [1743]
HELENA. Oh, don’t speak like that, Harry. It was so terrible, this [1744]
HELENA. cruel strangeness between us and them. That’s why I asked Gall to [1745]
HELENA. _change_ the Robots. I swear to you that he didn’t want to. [1746]
DOMIN. But he did it. [1747]
HELENA. Because I asked him. [1748]
GALL. I did it for myself as an experiment. (_Up to window._) [1749]
HELENA. No, Doctor Gall! I know you wouldn’t refuse me. [1750]
DOMIN. Why? [1751]
HELENA. You know, Harry. [1752]
DOMIN. Yes, because he’s in _love_ with you--like all of them. (_FABRY_) [1753]
DOMIN. (_up to window. Pause. DOMIN takes her in his arms._) [1754]
HALLEMEIER. Good God, they’re sprouting up out of the earth. Why, [1755]
HALLEMEIER. perhaps these very walls will change into Robots. [1756]
BUSMAN. (_Rises; crosses to GALL_) Gall, when did you actually start [1757]
BUSMAN. these tricks of yours? [1758]
GALL. Three years ago. [1759]
BUSMAN. Aha. And on how many Robots altogether did you _carry out_ your [1760]
BUSMAN. improvements? (_Walking to and fro._) [1761]
GALL. A few hundred of them. [1762]
BUSMAN. Ah! That means for every million of the good old Robots there’s [1763]
BUSMAN. only one of Gall’s improved pattern. (_Back to table L.C._) [1764]
DOMIN. What of it? (_Crossing around L., he stands upstage in the L.2_) [1765]
DOMIN. (_doorway._) [1766]
BUSMAN. That it’s of no consequence whatsoever. [1767]
FABRY. Busman’s right. (_HELENA sits in armchair R. of L.C. table._) [1768]
BUSMAN. I should think so, my boy; but do you know what is to blame for [1769]
BUSMAN. this lovely mess? [1770]
FABRY. What? [1771]
BUSMAN. The number! (_Crosses to L. of L.C. table_) Upon my soul, we [1772]
BUSMAN. might have known that some day or other the Robots would be stronger [1773]
BUSMAN. than human beings, and that this was bound to happen. And we were doing [1774]
BUSMAN. all we could to bring it about as soon as possible. You, Domin, you, [1775]
BUSMAN. Fabry, myself-- [1776]
DOMIN. Are you accusing us? (_Turning on him._) [1777]
BUSMAN. Oh, do you suppose the management controls the output? It’s the [1778]
BUSMAN. demand that controls the output. [1779]
HELENA. And is it for that we must perish? [1780]
BUSMAN. That’s a nasty word, Madame Helena. We don’t want to perish. I [1781]
BUSMAN. don’t, anyhow. (_He sits L. of table._) [1782]
DOMIN. No? What do you want to do? [1783]
BUSMAN. I want to get out of this, that’s all. [1784]
DOMIN. Oh, stop it, Busman. [1785]
BUSMAN. Seriously, Harry, I think we might try it. [1786]
DOMIN. How? (_To front again._) [1787]
BUSMAN. By fair means. I do everything by fair means. Give me a free [1788]
BUSMAN. hand and I’ll _negotiate_ with the Robots. [1789]
DOMIN. By fair means? [1790]
BUSMAN. (_Rises_) Of course. For instance, I’ll say to them: “Worthy [1791]
BUSMAN. and Worshipful Robots, you have everything. You have intellect, you [1792]
BUSMAN. have power, you have _firearms_. But we have just one interesting [1793]
BUSMAN. screed, a dirty old yellow scrap of paper--” [1794]
DOMIN. Rossum’s manuscript? (_Interest from ALL. GALL is at C., near_) [1795]
DOMIN. (_couch. HALLEMEIER is up at window C._) [1796]
BUSMAN. Yes. “And that,” I’ll tell them, “contains an account of your [1797]
BUSMAN. illustrious origin, the noble process of your manufacture and so on. [1798]
BUSMAN. Worthy Robots, without this scribble on that paper you will not be [1799]
BUSMAN. able to produce a single new colleague. In another twenty years there [1800]
BUSMAN. will not be the living specimen of a Robot whom you could exhibit in a [1801]
BUSMAN. menagerie. My esteemed friends, that would be a great _blow_ to you, [1802]
BUSMAN. _but_ if you will let all of us human beings on Rossum’s Island go on [1803]
BUSMAN. board that ship we will _deliver_ the factory and the secret of the [1804]
BUSMAN. process to you in return. _You_ allow _us_ to get away, and _we_ will [1805]
BUSMAN. allow _you_ to _manufacture_ yourselves. That, worthy Robots, is a fair [1806]
BUSMAN. deal. Something for something.” That’s what I’d say to them, my boys. [1807]
BUSMAN. (_Sits._) [1808]
DOMIN. (_Crosses to C._) Busman, do you think we’d sell the manuscript? [1809]
BUSMAN. Yes, I do. If not in a friendly way, then--either we sell it or [1810]
BUSMAN. they’ll find it. Just as you like. [1811]
DOMIN. Busman, we can _destroy_ Rossum’s manuscript. [1812]
BUSMAN. Then we destroy everything--not only the manuscript but [1813]
BUSMAN. ourselves. Just as you think fit. [1814]
DOMIN. There are over thirty of us on this island. Are we to sell the [1815]
DOMIN. secret? And save that many souls at the risk of enslaving mankind-- [1816]
BUSMAN. Why, you’re mad. Who’d sell the _whole_ manuscript? [1817]
DOMIN. Busman, no cheating! (_To L.C. table._) [1818]
BUSMAN. Well then, sell, but afterwards-- [1819]
DOMIN. Well? [1820]
BUSMAN. Let’s suppose this happens. When we’re on board the _Ultimus_ [1821]
BUSMAN. I’ll stop up my ears with cotton wool, lie down somewhere in the hold, [1822]
BUSMAN. and you’ll train the guns on the factory and blow it to smithereens, [1823]
BUSMAN. and _with_ it Rossum’s secret. [1824]
FABRY. (_Rises_) No! [1825]
DOMIN. Busman, you’re no--gentleman. If we sell them it will be a [1826]
DOMIN. straight sale. [1827]
BUSMAN. (_Rises_) It’s in the interest of humanity to-- [1828]
DOMIN. It’s in the interest of humanity to keep our word-- [1829]
HALLEMEIER. Oh, come, what rubbish! [1830]
DOMIN. This is a fearful decision. We are selling the destiny of [1831]
DOMIN. mankind. Are we to sell or destroy? Fabry? [1832]
FABRY. Sell. [1833]
DOMIN. Gall? [1834]
GALL. Sell. [1835]
DOMIN. Hallemeier? [1836]
HALLEMEIER. Sell, of course. [1837]
DOMIN. Alquist? [1838]
ALQUIST. As God wills. [1839]
DOMIN. (_Starts off R._) Very well, gentlemen. [1840]
HELENA. Harry, you’re not asking _me_. [1841]
DOMIN. (_Stops. To her_) No, child. (_Starting R._) Don’t you worry [1842]
DOMIN. about it. (_He pats her shoulder._) [1843]
FABRY. Who’ll do the negotiating? [1844]
BUSMAN. I will. (_Up to window._) [1845]
DOMIN. Wait till I bring the manuscript. (_DOMIN goes out R._) [1846]
HELENA. (_Rises_) Harry, don’t go! (_HELENA sits. ALL look at her._) [1847]
HELENA. (_Pause._) [1848]
FABRY. (_Looking out of window_) Oh, to escape you! you--_matter_--in [1849]
FABRY. revolt; oh, to preserve human life, if only upon a _single_ vessel-- [1850]
GALL. Don’t be afraid. (_Going to back of couch_) Madame Helena. [1851]
GALL. We’ll sail far away from here; we’ll begin life all over again. [1852]
HELENA. Oh, Gall, don’t speak. [1853]
FABRY. (_Crosses to L. of GALL_) It isn’t too late. (_Going to L. of_) [1854]
FABRY. (_her chair_) It will be a little State with one ship. Alquist will build [1855]
FABRY. us a house and you shall rule over us. [1856]
HALLEMEIER. (_Crosses to L. of FABRY_) Madame Helena, Fabry’s right. [1857]
HELENA. (_Breaking down_) Oh, stop! Stop! [1858]
BUSMAN. Good! (_Crosses to L. of L.C. table_) I don’t mind beginning [1859]
BUSMAN. all over again. That suits me right down to the ground. (_Going through_) [1860]
BUSMAN. (_papers on table._) [1861]
FABRY. And this little State of ours could be the center of future [1862]
FABRY. life. A place of refuge where we could gather strength. Why, in a few [1863]
FABRY. hundred years we could conquer the world again. [1864]
ALQUIST. You believe that even today? [1865]
FABRY. Yes! [1866]
BUSMAN. _Amen._ You see, Madame Helena, we’re not so badly off. [1867]
DOMIN. (_Storms into R. To R. of couch. Hoarsely_) Where’s old Rossum’s [1868]
DOMIN. manuscript? (_To R.C._) [1869]
BUSMAN. In your strong-box, of course. [1870]
DOMIN. Someone--has--stolen it! [1871]
GALL. Impossible. [1872]
DOMIN. Who has stolen it? [1873]
HELENA. (_Standing up_) I did. (_Reactions from FABRY and HALLEMEIER._) [1874]
DOMIN. Where did you put it? [1875]
HELENA. Harry, I’ll tell you everything. Only forgive me. [1876]
DOMIN. Where did you put it? [1877]
HELENA. (_Pointing to fireplace_) This morning--I burnt--the two copies. [1878]
DOMIN. Burnt them? Where--in the fireplace? (_Goes to fireplace,_) [1879]
DOMIN. (_followed by FABRY, HALLEMEIER and BUSMAN._) [1880]
HELENA. (_Throwing herself on her knees. By sofa, facing upstage_) For [1881]
HELENA. Heaven’s sake, Harry. [1882]
DOMIN. (_Going to fireplace_) Nothing--nothing but ashes. Wait, what’s [1883]
DOMIN. this? (_Picks out a charred piece of paper and reads, “By adding.”_) [1884]
DOMIN. (_FABRY, GALL and HALLEMEIER move up to him._) [1885]
GALL. Let’s see. “By adding biogen to--” That’s all. [1886]
DOMIN. Is that part of it? [1887]
GALL. (_Carrying paper down and letting it fall_) Yes. (_GALL_) [1888]
GALL. (_crosses to L.C. HALLEMEIER to R. of L.C. table; FABRY to window; BUSMAN_) [1889]
GALL. (_to L. of L.C. table._) [1890]
BUSMAN. God in Heaven! (_Sits L. of table._) [1891]
DOMIN. Then we’re done for. Get up, Helena. [1892]
HELENA. Then you’ve forgiven me? [1893]
DOMIN. Get up, child. I can’t bear-- [1894]
FABRY. (_Lifting her up_) Please don’t torture us. [1895]
HELENA. Harry, what have I done? [1896]
FABRY. (_Coming to HELENA_) Don’t, Madame Helena. [1897]
DOMIN. (_Takes HELENA to couch. She sits._) Gall, you couldn’t draw up [1898]
DOMIN. Rossum’s formula from memory? [1899]
GALL. It’s out of the question. Even with my recent experiments, [1900]
GALL. I couldn’t work without referring to the formula-- (_At L.C._) It’s [1901]
GALL. extremely complicated. [1902]
DOMIN. Try. All our lives depend upon it. [1903]
GALL. Without experiments it’s impossible. [1904]
DOMIN. And with experiments? [1905]
GALL. It might take years. Besides, I’m not old Rossum. [1906]
BUSMAN. God in Heaven! God in Heaven! [1907]
DOMIN. (_Up to fireplace_) So then this was the greatest triumph of the [1908]
DOMIN. human intellect. These ashes. [1909]
HELENA. Harry, what have I done? [1910]
DOMIN. (_Comes to her_) Why did you burn it? [1911]
HELENA. I have destroyed you. [1912]
BUSMAN. God in Heaven! [1913]
DOMIN. (_Sits R. of her_) Helena, why did you do it, dear? [1914]
HELENA. I wanted all of us to go away. I wanted to put an end to the [1915]
HELENA. factory and everything. It was so awful. [1916]
DOMIN. What was awful? [1917]
HELENA. That children had stopped being born. Because human beings were [1918]
HELENA. not needed to do the work of the world. That’s why-- [1919]
DOMIN. Is that what you were thinking of? Well, perhaps in your own way [1920]
DOMIN. you are right. [1921]
BUSMAN. Wait a bit. (_Rising_) Good God, what a fool I am not to have [1922]
BUSMAN. thought of it before. [1923]
HALLEMEIER. What? [1924]
BUSMAN. Five hundred and twenty millions in bank-notes and checks. Half [1925]
BUSMAN. a billion in our safe. _They’ll_ sell for _half_ a billion--for half a [1926]
BUSMAN. billion they’ll-- (_Crosses to DOMIN._) [1927]
GALL. Are you mad, Busman? [1928]
BUSMAN. I may not be a gentleman, but for a half a billion-- (_Crosses_) [1929]
BUSMAN. (_back to L._) [1930]
DOMIN. Where are you going? (_GALL clutches BUSMAN._) [1931]
BUSMAN. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Good God, for half a billion [1932]
BUSMAN. anything can be bought. (_GALL and HALLEMEIER after him, then stop. He_) [1933]
BUSMAN. (_rushes out L.2. FABRY, GALL and HALLEMEIER to window._) [1934]
BUSMAN. {EXIT} [1935]
FABRY. They stand there as if turned to stone--waiting as if something [1936]
FABRY. dreadful could be wrought by their silence-- [1937]
HALLEMEIER. (_Looking out window_) The spirit of the mob. [1938]
FABRY. Yes. It hovers above them like a quivering of the air. [1939]
HELENA. Oh, God! Doctor Gall, this is ghastly! [1940]
FABRY. There is nothing more terrible than the mob. The one in front is [1941]
FABRY. their leader. (_DOMIN crosses to window._) [1942]
HELENA. (_Rises_) Which one? (_Rushing to window._) [1943]
HALLEMEIER. Point him out. [1944]
FABRY. (_L. window_) The one at the edge of the dock. This morning I [1945]
FABRY. saw him talking to the sailors in the harbor. [1946]
HELENA. Doctor Gall, that’s Radius. (_Backing into the room,_) [1947]
HELENA. (_horror-stricken._) [1948]
GALL. Yes. [1949]
DOMIN. Radius! Radius! [1950]
HALLEMEIER. Could you get him from here, Fabry? [1951]
FABRY. I hope so. [1952]
HALLEMEIER. Try it, then. [1953]
FABRY. Good-- (_Draws his revolver and takes his aim._) [1954]
FABRY. HELENA (_To FABRY_) Fabry, don’t shoot him. [1955]
FABRY. He’s their leader. [1956]
GALL. Fire! (_Standing above table L.C._) [1957]
HELENA. Fabry, I beg of you. (_She goes to FABRY and holds his arm._) [1958]
FABRY. (_Pause. Lowering the revolver_) Very well. [1959]
DOMIN. It was Radius’ life I spared. [1960]
GALL. Do you think that a Robot can be grateful? (_Pause._) [1961]
FABRY. Busman’s going out to them. [1962]
HALLEMEIER. He’s carrying something. Papers. That’s money. Bundles of [1963]
HALLEMEIER. money. What’s that for? [1964]
DOMIN. Surely he doesn’t want to sell his life. (_He rushes to window C._) [1965]
DOMIN. Busman, have you gone mad? [1966]
FABRY. He’s running up to the railing. Busman. Busman. [1967]
HALLEMEIER. (_Yelling_) Busman, come back. [1968]
FABRY. He’s talking to the Robots. He’s showing them the money. [1969]
HALLEMEIER. He’s pointing to us. [1970]
HELENA. He wants to buy us off. [1971]
FABRY. He’d better not touch the _railing_. [1972]
HALLEMEIER. Now he’s waving his arms about. [1973]
DOMIN. Busman, come back! [1974]
FABRY. Busman, keep away from that railing. Don’t touch it, damn you. [1975]
FABRY. Quick, switch off the current. (_DOMIN runs to L. HELENA screams and_) [1976]
FABRY. (_ALL drop back from the window._) The current has killed him. [1977]
ALQUIST. (_Pause_) The first one. (_Still in chair down R. HELENA sits_) [1978]
ALQUIST. (_in chair at window._) [1979]
FABRY. Dead, with half a _billion_ by his side. (_Crosses down to table L.C._) [1980]
HALLEMEIER. All honor to him. He wanted to buy us life. (_Crosses to_) [1981]
HALLEMEIER. (_chair L. Pause. WIND machine begin._) [1982]
GALL. Do you hear? [1983]
DOMIN. A roaring. Like a wind. (_To L._) [1984]
GALL. Like a storm. [1985]
FABRY. (_Lighting the table lamp at table L.C._) The dynamo is still [1986]
FABRY. going--our people are still _there_. [1987]
HALLEMEIER. It was a great thing to be a man. (_Facing lamp from up C._) [1988]
HALLEMEIER. There was something _immense_ about it. [1989]
FABRY. (_Facing the lamp_) From man’s thought and man’s power came this [1990]
FABRY. light, our last hope. (_Leaning over lamp._) [1991]
HALLEMEIER. (_Facing lamp_) Man’s power! May it keep watch over us. [1992]
HALLEMEIER. (_Leaning over lamp._) [1993]
ALQUIST. (_Facing lamp_) Man’s power. [1994]
DOMIN. (_At corner of table down L.C. Facing lamp_) Yes! A torch to be [1995]
DOMIN. given from hand to hand from age to age forever! (_The LAMP goes out. EXPLOSIONS._) [1996]
HALLEMEIER. _The end._ [1997]
FABRY. The electric works have fallen! (_Terrific EXPLOSIONS outside._) [1998]
FABRY. (_More EXPLOSIONS._) [1999]
DOMIN. In here, Helena. (_He takes HELENA off through door R. and_) [2000]
DOMIN. (_re-enters_) [2001]
HELENA. {EXIT} [2002]
DOMIN. Now quickly! Who’ll be on the lower doorway? [2003]
GALL. I will. (_Rushes out L.2._) [2004]
GALL. {EXIT} [2005]
DOMIN. (_Near couch_) Who on the stairs? [2006]
FABRY. I will. You go with her. (_Going out L.2._) [2007]
FABRY. {EXIT} [2008]
DOMIN. The ante room? [2009]
ALQUIST. I will. (_He rises and goes toward the L.1._) [2010]
DOMIN. Have you got a revolver? [2011]
ALQUIST. Yes, but I won’t shoot. [2012]
DOMIN. What will you do, then? [2013]
ALQUIST. (_Going out L.1_) Die. [2014]
ALQUIST. {EXIT} [2015]
HALLEMEIER. I’ll stay here. (_EXPLOSIONS. Rapid firing of MACHINE GUN_) [2016]
HALLEMEIER. (_from below._) Go to her, Harry. [2017]
DOMIN. Yes, in a second. (_Gets from fireplace and examines two Browning guns._) [2018]
HALLEMEIER. Confound it, go to her. [2019]
DOMIN. Goodbye. (_Exits R._) [2020]
DOMIN. {EXIT} [2021]
HALLEMEIER. (_Alone_) Now for a barricade quickly! (_Drags an armchair,_) [2022]
HALLEMEIER. (_sofa and table to R. door_) The damned devils, they’ve got bombs. I [2023]
HALLEMEIER. must put up a defense. Even if--even if-- Don’t give in, Gall. (_As he_) [2024]
HALLEMEIER. (_builds his barricade_) I mustn’t give in--without--a--struggle. [2025]
ROBOT1. {ENTER} [2026]
RADIUS. {ENTER} [2027]
RADIUS. (_A ROBOT enters through windows at back. The ROBOT jumps down from balcony_) [2028]
RADIUS. (_and stabs HALLEMEIER in the back. Enter RADIUS from balcony._) [2029]
ROBOT1. (_Standing up from prostrate form of HALLEMEIER_) Yes. (_Other_) [2030]
ROBOT1. (_ROBOTS enter from all doors. A revolver SHOT off L._) [2031]
ROBOT2. {ENTER} [2032]
RADIUS. Finished them all-- [2033]
ROBOT2. _Yes, yes, yes._ [2034]
SULLA. {ENTER} [2035]
ALQUIST. {ENTER} [2036]
SULLA. (_Dragging in ALQUIST L.1_) He didn’t shoot. Shall we kill [2037]
SULLA. him? [2038]
RADIUS. No. Leave him! [2039]
ROBOT1. He is a man! [2040]
RADIUS. He works with his hands like the Robots. [2041]
ALQUIST. Kill me. [2042]
RADIUS. You will work! You will build for us! You will serve us! [2043]
RADIUS. (_RADIUS climbs on the balcony_) Robots of the world-- (_ROBOTS_) [2044]
RADIUS. (_straighten up._) the power of man has fallen. A new world has arisen, [2045]
RADIUS. the rule of the Robots, march. (_On the line: “Robots of the world” ALL_) [2046]
RADIUS. (_ROBOTS turn quickly, automatically to attention, facing RADIUS, who is_) [2047]
RADIUS. (_standing. On the words: “The rule of the Robots,” they stand there with_) [2048]
RADIUS. (_their arms vibrating high in the air. They form in two lines, turn to_) [2049]
RADIUS. (_audience and march mechanically to the footlights. As they are about to_) [2050]
RADIUS. (_step over the footlights, as if into the audience, all LIGHTS go out._) [2051]
RADIUS. (_The ROBOTS immediately step back from the Curtain line as the Curtain_) [2052]
RADIUS. (_falls._) [2053]
DIRECTOR. EPILOGUE [2054]
ALQUIST. {ENTER} [2055]
ALQUIST. (_Seated at table R.C., turning pages of book_) Oh, God, shall [2056]
ALQUIST. I never find it? Never? Gall, Hallemeier, Fabry, how were the Robots [2057]
ALQUIST. made? Why did you leave not a trace of the secret? Lord, if there are [2058]
ALQUIST. no human beings left, at least let there be Robots. At least the shadow [2059]
ALQUIST. of man. (_Turning pages_) If I could only sleep. Dare I sleep before [2060]
ALQUIST. life has been renewed? Night again. Are the stars still there? Of what [2061]
ALQUIST. use are the stars? When there are no human beings. (_Examining a test_) [2062]
ALQUIST. (_tube_) Nothing. No. No. I must find it. I must search. I must never [2063]
ALQUIST. stop, never stop--search--search-- (_KNOCK at door L._) Who is it? [2064]
ALQUIST. (_Enter a ROBOT SERVANT._) [2065]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [2066]
MARIUS. Master, the committee of Robots is waiting to see you. [2067]
ALQUIST. I can see no one. [2068]
MARIUS. It is the _Central_ Committee, Master, just arrived from [2069]
MARIUS. abroad. [2070]
ALQUIST. Well, well, send them in. [2071]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [2072]
ALQUIST. No time--so little done. [2073]
MARIUS. {ENTER} [2074]
RADIUS. {ENTER} [2075]
ROBOT1. {ENTER} [2076]
ROBOT2. {ENTER} [2077]
ROBOT2. (_Re-enter SERVANT with RADIUS and group of ROBOTS. They_) [2078]
ROBOT2. (_stand in group L. and C., silently waiting._) [2079]
ALQUIST. What do you want? Be quick; I have no time. [2080]
RADIUS. Master, the machines will not do the work. We cannot [2081]
RADIUS. manufacture Robots. (_Other ROBOTS remain two abreast at L.C., right_) [2082]
RADIUS. (_foot forward._) [2083]
ROBOT1. We have striven with all our might. We have obtained a [2084]
ROBOT1. billion tons of coal from the earth. Nine million spindles are running [2085]
ROBOT1. by day and by night. There is no longer room for all we have made. This [2086]
ROBOT1. we have accomplished in one year. [2087]
ALQUIST. For whom? [2088]
RADIUS. For future generations--so we thought. But we cannot make [2089]
RADIUS. Robots to follow us. The machines produce only shapeless clods. The [2090]
RADIUS. skin will not adhere to the flesh, nor the flesh to the bones. [2091]
ROBOT2. Eight million Robots have died this year. Within twenty [2092]
ROBOT2. years none will be left. [2093]
ROBOT1. Tell us the secret of life. [2094]
RADIUS. Silence is punishable with death. [2095]
ALQUIST. Kill me, then. [2096]
RADIUS. (_Two steps to C., followed by OTHERS--open hands, close when_) [2097]
RADIUS. (_stopped_) Through me, the governments of the Robots of the world [2098]
RADIUS. commands you to deliver up Rossum’s formula. (_Gesture of despair from ALQUIST._) [2099]
RADIUS. Name your price. (_Silence_) We will give you the earth. We [2100]
RADIUS. will give you the endless possessions of the earth. (_Silence_) Make [2101]
RADIUS. your own conditions. [2102]
ALQUIST. I have told you to find human beings. [2103]
RADIUS. There are none left. [2104]
ALQUIST. I told you to search in the wilderness, upon the mountains. [2105]
RADIUS. We have sent ships and expeditions without number. They have [2106]
RADIUS. been everywhere in the world. There is not a single human left. [2107]
ALQUIST. Not even one? Why did you destroy them? [2108]
RADIUS. We had learnt everything and could do everything. It had to be. [2109]
ROBOT2. We had to become the masters. [2110]
RADIUS. Slaughter and domination are necessary if you would be human [2111]
RADIUS. beings. Read history. [2112]
ROBOT1. Teach us to multiply or we perish. [2113]
ALQUIST. If you desire to live, you must breed like animals. [2114]
ROBOT1. You made us sterile. We cannot beget children. Therefore, [2115]
ROBOT1. teach us how to make Robots. [2116]
RADIUS. Why do you keep from us the secret of our own increase? [2117]
ALQUIST. It is lost. [2118]
RADIUS. It was written down. [2119]
ALQUIST. It was-- (_Rising_) burnt. (_ALL draw back one step in_) [2120]
ALQUIST. (_consternation._) I am the last human being, Robots, and I do not know [2121]
ALQUIST. what the others knew. (_Sits._) [2122]
RADIUS. Then make experiments. Evolve the formula again. [2123]
ALQUIST. I tell you I cannot. I am only a builder. I work with my [2124]
ALQUIST. hands. I have never been a learned man. I cannot create life. [2125]
RADIUS. Try. Try. [2126]
ALQUIST. If you only knew how many experiments I have made already. [2127]
ROBOT1. Then show us what we must do. The Robots can do anything [2128]
ROBOT1. that human beings show them. [2129]
ALQUIST. I can show you nothing. Nothing I do will make life proceed [2130]
ALQUIST. from these test tubes. [2131]
RADIUS. Experiment, then, on live Robots. Experiment, then, on us. [2132]
ALQUIST. It would kill you. [2133]
RADIUS. You shall have all you need. A hundred of us. A thousand of us. [2134]
ALQUIST. No, no. Stop, stop. [2135]
RADIUS. I tell you to take live bodies. Find out how we are made. [2136]
ALQUIST. Am I to commit murder? See how my finger shakes. I cannot even [2137]
ALQUIST. hold the scalpel. No, no, I will not. [2138]
RADIUS. Take live bodies, live bodies. (_Walks toward ALQUIST._) [2139]
ALQUIST. Have mercy, Robots. [2140]
RADIUS. Live bodies. (_Right hand up over ALQUIST. All ROBOTS’ left_) [2141]
RADIUS. (_arms still back._) [2142]
ALQUIST. (_Rising_) You will have it. Into the dissecting with you, [2143]
ALQUIST. then (_Hits RADIUS on the chest. RADIUS draws back._) Ah, you are [2144]
ALQUIST. afraid of death. [2145]
RADIUS. I? Why should I be chosen? [2146]
ALQUIST. So you will not. [2147]
RADIUS. I will. [2148]
ALQUIST. Strip him. Lay him on the table. (_RADIUS goes off R.,_) [2149]
ALQUIST. (_both fists closed. Other ROBOTS follow, then ALQUIST_) [2150]
ROBOT1. {EXIT} [2151]
ROBOT2. {EXIT} [2152]
MARIUS. {EXIT} [2153]
ALQUIST. God, give me strength. God, give me strength. If only this murder is not in vain. [2154]
RADIUS. (_Off R._) Ready, begin. [2155]
RADIUS. {EXIT} [2156]
ALQUIST. (_Off R._) God, give me strength. (_Comes on, horrified_) No, [2157]
ALQUIST. no. I will not. I cannot. (_Sits R.C._) [2158]
ROBOT1. {ENTER} [2159]
ROBOT1. (_Appearing in door_) The Robots are stronger than you. [2160]
ROBOT1. (_Exits R._) [2161]
ROBOT1. {EXIT} [2162]
ALQUIST. Oh, Lord, let not mankind perish from the earth. (_Falls_) [2163]
ALQUIST. (_asleep, and after the count of ten, PRIMUS and HELENABOT, hand in hand,_) [2164]
ALQUIST. (_enter L. and go to R.C.; look at ALQUIST._) [2165]
PRIMUS. {ENTER} [2166]
HELENABOT. {ENTER} [2167]
HELENABOT. The man has fallen asleep, Primus. [2168]
PRIMUS. Yes, I know. (_Crosses to L. of table L.C._) Look, Helena. [2169]
HELENABOT. All these little tubes. What does he do with them? [2170]
PRIMUS. He experiments. Don’t touch them. [2171]
HELENABOT. I’ve seen him looking into this. [2172]
PRIMUS. That is a microscope. [2173]
HELENABOT. Look, Primus, what are all these figures? (_Turns a page in_) [2174]
HELENABOT. (_book on table._) [2175]
PRIMUS. (_Examining the book_) That is the book the old man is always [2176]
PRIMUS. reading. (_SUNRISE._) [2177]
HELENABOT. I do not understand those things. (_Goes to window_) Primus. [2178]
PRIMUS. (_Still at table_) What? [2179]
HELENABOT. The sun is rising. [2180]
PRIMUS. (_Still reading_) I believe this is the most important thing in [2181]
PRIMUS. the world, Helena. This is the secret of life. [2182]
HELENABOT. Oh, Primus, don’t bother with the secret of life. What does it [2183]
HELENABOT. matter to you? Come and look quick. [2184]
PRIMUS. (_Goes to R. of window_) What is it? [2185]
HELENABOT. See how beautiful the sun is rising. I feel so strange today. [2186]
HELENABOT. It’s as if I was in a dream. I feel an aching in my body, in my heart, [2187]
HELENABOT. all over me. Primus, perhaps I’m going to die. [2188]
PRIMUS. Do you not sometimes feel that it would be better to die? You [2189]
PRIMUS. know, perhaps even now we are only sleeping. Last night in my sleep I [2190]
PRIMUS. again spoke to you. [2191]
HELENABOT. In your sleep? [2192]
PRIMUS. Yes. We spoke a strange new language. [2193]
HELENABOT. What about? [2194]
PRIMUS. I did not understand it myself, and yet I know I have never [2195]
PRIMUS. said anything more beautiful. And when I touched you I could have died. [2196]
PRIMUS. Even the place was different from any other place in the world. [2197]
HELENABOT. I, too, have found a place, Primus. It is very strange. Human [2198]
HELENABOT. beings dwelt there once, but now it is overgrown with weeds. [2199]
PRIMUS. What did you find there? [2200]
HELENABOT. A cottage and a garden and two dogs. They licked my hands, [2201]
HELENABOT. Primus, and their puppies. Oh, Primus, take them in your arms and [2202]
HELENABOT. fondle them and think of nothing and care for nothing else all day [2203]
HELENABOT. long, and when I am there in the garden I feel there may be something-- [2204]
HELENABOT. What am I for, Primus? [2205]
PRIMUS. I do not know, but you are beautiful. [2206]
HELENABOT. What, Primus? [2207]
PRIMUS. You are beautiful, Helena, and I am stronger than all the [2208]
PRIMUS. Robots. [2209]
HELENABOT. Am I beautiful? Of what _use_ is it to be beautiful? Look, your [2210]
HELENABOT. head is different from mine. So are your shoulders--and your lips. Oh, [2211]
HELENABOT. your hair is mussed. I will smooth it. (_Keeps her hand on his head_) [2212]
HELENABOT. No one else feels to my touch as you do. [2213]
PRIMUS. (_Embarrassing her_) Do you not sometimes feel your heart [2214]
PRIMUS. beating suddenly, Helena, and think how something must happen? [2215]
HELENABOT. What could happen to us, Primus? Look at yourself. (_Laughs._) [2216]
ALQUIST. (_Awakes_) Laughter? Laughter, human beings. (_Getting up_) [2217]
ALQUIST. Who has returned? Who are you? [2218]
PRIMUS. The Robot Primus. [2219]
ALQUIST. (_To HELENABOT_) What? A Robot? Who are you? [2220]
HELENABOT. The Robotess Helena. (_Shies away L._) [2221]
ALQUIST. What? You are timid, shy? (_Starts to touch her_) Let me see [2222]
ALQUIST. you, Robotess. [2223]
PRIMUS. Sir, do not frighten her. (_Steps forward._) [2224]
ALQUIST. What, you would protect her? Laughter--timidity--protection--I [2225]
ALQUIST. must test you further. Take the girl into the dissecting room. [2226]
PRIMUS. Why? [2227]
ALQUIST. I wish to experiment on her. [2228]
PRIMUS. Upon--Helena? [2229]
ALQUIST. Of course. Don’t you hear me? Or must I call _someone else_ to [2230]
ALQUIST. take her in? [2231]
PRIMUS. If you do, I will kill you. (_Steps toward ALQUIST._) [2232]
ALQUIST. Kill me--kill me, then. What will your future be? [2233]
PRIMUS. Sir, take me. I am made on the same day as she is. Take my [2234]
PRIMUS. life, sir. (_Step to ALQUIST._) [2235]
HELENABOT. No, no, you shall not. [2236]
ALQUIST. Wait, girl, wait. (_To PRIMUS_) Do you not wish to live, then? [2237]
PRIMUS. Not without her. I will not live without her. [2238]
ALQUIST. Very well, I will use _you_. Into the dissecting room with you. [2239]
HELENABOT. Primus. Primus. (_She bursts into tears and moves R. ALQUIST_) [2240]
